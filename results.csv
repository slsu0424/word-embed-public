We encountered several difficulties during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way, a position change to the 135° prone position () took around 30 minutes. This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example, on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation. Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.","[[60.0, 'year']]",M,"['7665777-2', '7665777-3', '7665777-4', '7665777-5', '7665777-6', '7665777-7', '7665777-8', '7665777-9', '7665777-10', '7665777-11']","['32320506', '32293716', '23219649', '30339549', '17470624', '32280973', '34789437', '30427933', '32191813', '31064802', '12493078', '23688302', '24552321', '34602603', '29208005', '32312646', '20046114', '32250385', '23886842', '32345343', '17885261', '29023260', '27940276', '31768568', '34953756', '30113379', '28847238', '33492400']"
16,8675570-1,34956761,comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8675570.xml,Bilateral Ureteral Obstruction Causing Acute Kidney Injury and Resultant Metformin Toxicity,"We describe the case of a 55-year-old male who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services for the chief complaint of sudden onset shortness of breath that woke him from his sleep just prior to arrival. He reported three days of non-radiating lumbar back pain and two episodes of non-bloody emesis leading up to this event. His medical history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications were metformin, amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol. Initial vital signs revealed heart rate (HR) 75, respiratory rate (RR) 29, blood pressure (BP) 119/62, and oxygen saturation 99% on 2L nasal cannula. Temperature was 36.3°C.
Physical examination was significant for an ill-appearing male patient who was anxious and tachypneic. He also had significant work of breathing with retractions and abdominal breathing. Lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezing, rhonchi, or rales. Abdominal exam revealed mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound, guarding, or palpable pulsatile mass. No costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness or midline tenderness was elicited. Neurological exam revealed no focal deficits.
Due to his presentation and multiple comorbidities we had significant concern for the possible acute coronary syndrome, dissection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Blood work including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lactic acid, troponin, urine analysis (UA) was ordered. CT-angiogram of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also ordered.
Complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 20.4 x 103/uL, hemoglobin of 11.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 376 x 103/uL. Comprehensive metabolic panel was significant for a sodium of 145 mmol/L, potassium 6.1 mmol/L, chloride 100 mmol/l, bicarbonate <7 mmol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 67 mg/dl, creatinine 14.7 mg/dL, calcium 9.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 165. Troponin I was <0.012 ng/mL. Initial lactic acid was recorded at 13.9 mmol/L. An arterial blood gas revealed severe anion gap metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 22.3 mmHg, pO2 of 105.5 mmHg, HCO3 of 5.3 meq/L, and a Base Excess of -24.8 mmol/l. The patient was anuric at this time. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm (NSR), nonspecific ST abnormalities, vent rate 73, QTC 471. The CT scan revealed an obstructing stone at the left proximal ureteropelvic junction (Figures , ) and at the right ureterovesical junction (Figure ), with resultant bilateral hydronephrosis (Figure ).
While in the ED the patient progressively became hypotensive and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, due to concern for sepsis and aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated. The patient did not respond to fluid resuscitation and was started initially on Levophed. In addition, the patient received 100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 2 grams of calcium gluconate for severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Due to the expected clinical decline, the patient was intubated in the emergency department. Critical Care, Nephrology, and Urology were consulted emergently in the ED. After initial stabilization, the patient was taken for immediate bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) placement by Interventional Radiology (IR) and placement of a trialysis catheter for initiation of hemodialysis afterward. Urinalysis from the PCN revealed hematuria, but no evidence of infection.
After successful placement of bilateral PCN, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition. He was maintained on multiple vasopressors consisting of combinations of norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine, and phenylephrine along with stress dose hydrocortisone. Repeat blood gas and labs revealed a worsening metabolic and lactic acidosis with a repeat pH of 6.7 and a lactic acid of 15.9. The patient was started on hemodialysis with a high bicarbonate dialysate for emergent clearance of hyperkalemia and refractory acidosis. After hemodialysis, the patient’s pH was 7.1, despite a worsening lactic acidosis of 17.0 mmol/L. Overnight the patient was converted to continuous venous-venous hemodialysis, a form of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Within 24 hours the patient’s acidemia corrected and blood pressure stabilized allowing for a de-escalation of vasopressors. A repeat chemistry revealed recovering renal function along with urine production in the nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 3, the patient was successfully extubated, weaned off all vasopressors, and CRRT was stopped. Blood and urine cultures taken prior to dialysis were negative after five days. On hospital day 6, Urology performed a cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stent placement and removal of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. On hospital day 8, the patient had made a remarkable recovery from being critically ill. His creatinine was 1.5, BUN 27, and he was discharged home with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks.","[[55.0, 'year']]",M,"['7202579-1', '6916532-1', '6777935-1']","['26800971', '27030462', '24251430', '26981442', '25215151', '25860205', '22154632', '22722338', '26773926', '32382466', '31842973', '25552792', '22517736', '31598437', '34956761']"
72,8698451-1,34943737,comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8698451.xml,Early Diagnosis and Antibiotic Treatment Combined with Multicomponent Hemodynamic Support for Addressing a Severe Case of Lemierre’s Syndrome,"A 20-year-old Caucasian male (1.75 m tall and 76 kg (BMI 24.8)), was admitted to the medical department for persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. Persistent symptoms started at home 4 days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed jaundice, dry mucous membranes, pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate, and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. He was tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute) and the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) in room air was 92%. The abdominal palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory tests showed a white blood count (WBC) of 8000 cells/mcL with 74% neutrophils, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 31,000/mcL), total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, AST 150 UI/L, ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly ().
The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein ().
On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight) spectrometry -Vitek ®MS Blood cultures performed at admission and on the second day and collected in standard anaerobic blood culture bottles were positive ().
The association of retropharyngeal abscess with thrombosis of the anterior jugular and involvement of other organs systemically and the microbiology led to the diagnosis of Lemierre’s syndrome. Despite empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (18 g/day, continuous infusion), there was a rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of the respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations (mean arterial pressure (MAP) constantly <65 mmHg). This picture suggested a progression towards a septic shock status. Consequently, the patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre’s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) ().
The source control was planned in a sterile environment. Under general anesthesia, the patient underwent an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. Unfortunately, although the procedure revealed purulent material, surgeons were unable to collect suitable samples for microbiological testing.
At ICU admission, the patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and the need for deep sedation (propofol, remifentanil, and clonidine), and mechanical ventilation through protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg and driving pressure < 15 cmH2O) and high FiO2 (80%). The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 12, predicting a high mortality rate (50%) [].
About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole (500 mg q8hr, intravenously) was added to piperacillin/tazobactam (started empirically at hospital admission). This antibiotic therapy was based on anecdotal clinical evidence because, due to the lack of cards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobes in the laboratory, the antibiogram was not performed.
Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin (also known as arginine-vasopressin or anti-diuretic hormone) (EMPRESSIN® AOP Orphan Pharmaceutical Group) starting with norepinephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and argipressin at 0.03 IU/min to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg and lactic acid < 2 mmol/L. On day 2, the drug synergism allowed the rapid reduction of the norepinephrine and argipressin dosages (0.1 mcg/kg/min and 0.025 IU/min, respectively) ().
On the same day (day 2), there was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved ().
Despite the adequate MAP (>65 mmHg), from the 3rd to the 6th day of ICU admission, there was a new worsening of the clinical status. It featured anemia (worse value 6.8 g/dL) without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring (Edwards EV1000™ device) showed a hyperdynamic septic state (Cardiac Output 15 L/min, Systemic Vascular Resistance 300 dynes/seconds/cm). Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, on the 8th day, hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) was added to argipressin and norepinephrine. This approach led to a paramount hemodynamic improvement. From the 8th day of hospitalization, there was a progressive reduction of the dose of both vasoconstrictors until the suspension of norepinephrine, on day 9, and argipressin, on day 12 of ICU stay. Moreover, there was an important decrease in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (from 12 on ICU admission to 7 on day 9).
The worsening of the clinical status and the anemia were associated with bilirubin and cytokines rise. The inflammatory response was treated by 4 cycles of continuous hemofiltration (from 4th to 7th day). At the end of the procedure, there was an unexpected rise in D-dimers and in bilirubin values, up to 15.3 mg/dL (10th day), as well as hyperpyrexia. Nevertheless, these findings improved within 24 h.
Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia (enoxaparin 6000 U/day at the beginning and 4000 U twice a day after normalization of the platelet count) monitoring D-dimer values and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy.
On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion and a new CT was carried out. It showed a persistence of the known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as the normalization of hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program. After the discharge to the rehabilitation care unit, the young man was in good health condition. At the first follow up, performed 15 days after ICU admission, the CT scan showed better lungs ventilation, absence of retropharyngeal abscess, laterocervical lymphadenopathy, and internal jugular thrombosis. Hepatosplenomegaly and some cavitary lungs lesions were found. Another thoracic CT scan was performed after 3 months. It demonstrated an improvement of both the lung lesions and hepatosplenomegaly.","[[20.0, 'year']]",M,"['4015694-1', '6051090-1', '3963201-1']","['19554637', '24152679', '30671334', '30057835', '20517699', '18278528', '30903538', '11928085', '30742785', '21847649', '30893539', '19237882', '26744664', '28296657', '15192164', '31283769', '28009937', '15901643', '27378578', '18305265', '32303484', '27061116', '15390207', '24701068', '11871622', '27483065', '18330604', '11529214', '28114553', '30784607', '17713417', '16963005', '11555538', '34160666', '22561543', '28940017', '28646962', '12186604', '28101605', '24717459', '24557425', '10987717', '22633566', '34943737']"
62035,5039222-1,26289291,comm/PMC005xxxxxx/PMC5039222.xml,A young girl with an unusual cause of acute kidney injury: Questions,"A previously healthy 3-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a general hospital with high-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing. A week prior to presentation, she had low-grade fever, a sore throat, a red tongue, and bilateral purulent conjunctivitis. In between these two episodes, there was a relatively symptom-free interval. There were no explicit environmental exposures, such as contact with rodents. She did not use any medication, especially no antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
At the emergency department, she showed signs of shock with a decreased level of consciousness, confusion, tachypnea (44–48 breaths per minute), tachycardia (151–162 beats per minute), and low blood pressure (62/46 mmHg). On physical examination, she displayed generalized exanthema with desquamation of the skin and lips, a red tongue, enlarged (almost kissing) tonsils, conjunctivitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Auscultation of heart and lungs was unremarkable. Abdominal examination revealed bilateral flank pain.
Fluid boluses were administered to stabilize the shock. There was no need for inotropic or vasopressor support. Antipyretics (acetaminophen) were given to lower the fever and, after collection of blood cultures, broad-spectrum intravenous cephalosporin antibiotics (ceftriaxone) were started. This resulted in improvement of her mental state and hemodynamic parameters. The next day, despite extensive fluid therapy, she was still oliguric and developed generalized edema. Laboratory tests showed acute kidney injury (Table ). Therefore, she was transferred to the paediatric nephrology department of our university medical centre.
On admission, she was clinically stable and normotensive. In order to determine the extent and course of her infection and kidney injury, we performed several laboratory tests, the results of which are shown in Table . Further laboratory evaluation was carried out to unravel the cause of her kidney injury. The results of this evaluation will be elaborated upon in the Answers section (). A renal ultrasound was done, which showed both kidneys to be enlarged with a normal corticomedullary differentiation, normal flow in the renal artery and vein, and no dilatation or signs of urolithiasis.
A rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis seemed likely considering the hematuria, proteinuria, edema, reduced renal function, and enlarged kidneys seen on ultrasound. A renal biopsy was performed and our patient was started on methylprednisolone pulse therapy for three consecutive days, followed by oral prednisone. The biopsy specimen was processed for light and immunofluorescence microscopy using standard techniques. Light microscopic sections showed on average 20 glomeruli, none obsolescent, all unremarkable. There were no abnormalities of the arteries and arterioles. A distinct interstitial infiltrate was seen, most prominent in the medullary areas of the biopsy, consisting of both mononuclear cells and neutrophils. Furthermore, the interstitium was markedly hemorrhagic with relatively mild tubulitis. A few intraluminal pus collections were noted. Viral inclusions and viral cytopathic changes were not detected. Immunofluorescence studies showed no staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C1q, C3, or light chains. The biopsy was consistent with a diffuse hemorrhagic interstitial nephritis (Fig. ).
The blood culture revealed a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), for which antibiotic therapy could be narrowed down to intravenous penicillin. Fever disappeared, skin and eyes improved, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood leukocytes declined. Following a regimen of fluid and dietary restrictions combined with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and subsequent oral prednisone, diuresis and overall clinical condition improved, renal function recovered, and hematuria and proteinuria subsided (Table ). A short period of moderate polyuria occurred during recovery. After 11 days, our patient was discharged with a normal renal function, minimal residual proteinuria, and normal blood pressure. Follow-up has been uneventful so far.","[[3.0, 'year']]",F,[],['26289291']
62036,5039266-1,27703825,comm/PMC005xxxxxx/PMC5039266.xml,Solitary Spinal Epidural Metastasis from Gastric Cancer,"The patient was a 79-year-old man with the chief complaints of paraplegia and dysuria.
Bilateral muscle weakness of the lower limbs developed with no known cause in October 20××. The symptoms gradually became aggravated, and it became difficult for the patient to stand up from November. Dysuria appeared after several days and activities of daily living also became difficult. Thus, the patient was urgently admitted for close examination and treatment.
The patient had a past medical history of gastric cancer and had undergone total gastrectomy in March, followed by postoperative chemotherapy (combination of oral 5FU preparation S-1 + cisplatin) from April to July.
The muscle strength of the lower limbs on admission was MMT3 in all of the bilateral iliopsoas, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, and flexor hallucis longus muscles, showing complete bilateral muscle weakness of the lower limbs. Regarding sensation, 1/10 hypaesthesia was noted in the T4 or lower regions. The bilateral patellar tendon and Achilles tendon reflexes were normal, and Babinski and Chaddock reflexes were negative. Since difficulty in urination and abdominal distension were noted, urethral catheterization was performed, and 1400 mL of urine was drained.
On blood testing, WBC was 4,200/μL and CRP was 0.6 mg/dL, showing a mild inflammatory response, Hgb was 9.9 g/dL, and Plt was 10.9 × 104
μL, showing pancytopenia. LDH was 275 IU/L, AST was 33 IU/L, and ALT was 59 IU/L, indicating elevation of liver enzymes. ALP was 355 IU/L, and Ca was 8.0 mg/dL. With respect to tumor markers, CEA, CA19-9, and AFP were increased to 15.2 ng/mL, 1,420 U/mL, and 1,034 ng/mL, respectively.
On cerebrospinal fluid testing, the fluid was transparent, and the cell count was elevated to 32/μL (polymorphonuclear leukocyte: 81%, mononuclear cell: 19%). The glucose and protein levels were increased to 104 mg/dL and 181 mg/dL, respectively. CEA was <0.50 ng/dL, which was within the normal range. No malignant findings were noted on cerebrospinal fluid cytology, which was judged as Class I.
On thoracic spinal plain radiography, no apparent abnormal findings, that is, osteolytic findings of the vertebrae and pedicle sign, were noted. On thoracic spinal MRI, a low-isointensity region was observed in the dorsal dura mater on T1-weighted imaging and an iso-high intensity mass lesion was observed on T2-weighted imaging at the T2–4 level; the lesion excluded the dural canal from the dorsal side (). On head, chest, and abdominal CT, head and spinal MRI, and PET, no apparent mass lesions other than the thoracic spinal epidural mass were observed ().
Paralysis progressed from Frankel C to A at 4 days after admission, and emergency surgery was performed to treat the epidural occupying lesion of the thoracic spine. Laminectomy and tumor excision were applied at the T2–5 level. A grayish white tumorous lesion was present in the dorsal dura mater and markedly obstructed the dural canal from the posterior side. The tumor parenchymal tissue was fragile and hemorrhagic. Since adhesion between the dura mater and tumor was marked, en bloc excision was attempted but was difficult, and the lesion was resected piece by piece as much as possible, and sufficient decompression of the dural canal was achieved.
On pathological examination, outgrowth of cells containing swollen nuclei to a solid tumor was observed, with a few gland duct-like structures. Alcian-blue staining-positive mucus production was observed, suggesting poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (). The histology of the lesion was similar to that of lymph node metastasis, which is observed in gastric cancer surgery, suggesting metastasis from gastric cancer.
The neurologic manifestation did not improve after surgery. The lesion was clinically diagnosed as metastatic tumor of gastric cancer, and treatment with irradiation and chemotherapy were suggested; however, best supportive care was selected because the general condition was poor due to the complication with pneumonia. Ultimately, pneumonia-aggravated, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred, and the patient died 27 days after admission.","[[79.0, 'year']]",M,['4641720-1'],"['25588752', '2096606', '15629272', '12846501', '26623201', '17857618', '21618333', '1590123', '21887484', '655653', '29051204', '20808299', '20630663', '18420159', '27703825']"

The patient initially needed 4 L/min of oxygen, had a rapid and shallow breathing pattern at rest and became severely breathless during minor physical activities. In the beginning, physical therapy focused on patient education about dyspnea-relieving positions, the importance of regular mobilization, and deep-breathing exercises. However, it quickly became evident that his anxiety from fear of dying and worries about his future aggravated his dyspnea and vice versa. The patient was so dyspneic, anxious, and weak that he was barely able to walk to the toilet. To counter this vicious circle, the physical therapist actively listened to the patient, explained why he was experiencing breathlessness, and tested suitable positions to relieve his dyspnea. He seemed to benefit from the education and the relaxing breathing exercises, as seen on day 2, when his respiratory rate could be reduced from 30 breaths/min to 22 breaths/min and his oxygen saturation increased from 92% to 96% on 4 L/min oxygen after guiding him through some deep-breathing exercises. Over the next days, his dyspnea and anxiety started to alleviate and he regained his self-confidence.

Her cardiovascular symptoms started one month before the presentation with a history of recurrent episodes of shortness of breath, palpitations, and chest pain. The severity of the symptoms has increased in the past few weeks. At the time of referral, she was on furosemide 10 mg twice daily and enalapril 10 mg once daily. Her parents are phenotypically normal. All her siblings, five brothers and two sisters, are free from the disorder. Also, the patient has a remarkable family history, as her cousin is a 20-year-old male with the same disorder. There is consanguinity between parents in the family. On general examination, she had a senile appearance with generalized inelastic, loose, and sagging skin. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% in room air, and temperature of 36 °C. On cardiac examination, the precordium was hyperactive, the first and second heart sounds were obscured, and pansystolic murmur grade III/VI radiating to the axilla was detected. The hematological studies were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with right atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure ). Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with subsegmental atelectasis (Figure ). For more assessment and operative plan, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed severe mitral and tricuspid valve prolapse with malcoaptation causing severe regurgitation of both valves with pulmonary hypertension and severe dilatation of both right and left atria (Figures -). After the patient’s condition was discussed in the heart team meeting, the plan was set for mitral and tricuspid valve repair versus replacement, depending on the intraoperative findings. Also, the patient was planned to be counseled by a medical geneticist. The case was discussed with the patient and her family as they were involved in the clinical decision.
Procedure
Under general anesthesia, midline sternotomy was carried out, and the thymus was resected due to its enormous size. Standard cannulation was accomplished through the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava with snugging around each cannula. Consequently, standard cardioplegic arrest with full flow of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was achieved as the patient was cooled down to a temperature of 30 °C. The aortic valve was immediately examined after the aorta was transversely opened, and it had some significant enlargement and dilatation of the leaflet, but the valve was manually competent; thence, no intervention was done to the aortic valve. Both atria were significantly enlarged; thereupon, right and left atrial appendages were resected in combination with atrioplasty (Figures , ). The left atrium was opened, the mitral valve was examined and showed significant myxomatous changes of both anterior and posterior leaflets, and the valve was irreparable. Hence, the decision was made intraoperatively to replace the mitral valve with a 33-mm St. Jude Medical Epic porcine valve prosthesis (Figure ). After this, through an incision into the right atrium, the tricuspid valve was found to have a cleft at the septal leaflet and the anterior leaflet with significant dilation of the annulus. Accordingly, commissural tricuspid annuloplasty was performed. The tricuspid valve test rendered a competent valve. After completing the procedure, the patient was fully rewarmed and weaned off CPB. Intraoperative TEE showed trace tricuspid regurgitation, and the prosthetic valve was well seated at the mitral position. With these findings, the patient was decannulated, chest tubes and pacer wire were inserted, and closure was performed. She was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) in a stable condition. During the first 15 hours in the CSICU, the chest tubes drained blood in a total of 1,450 mL (right lower pleura), 300 mL (mediastinum), and 1,330 mL (left lower pleura). Afterward, the patient received five units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), seven units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), two units of cryoprecipitated antihemophilic factor (Cryo), two units of platelets, and two doses of intravenous protamine sulfate (50 mg per dose). The bleeding was then controlled (Table ). The patient was shifted from the CSICU to the ward on postoperative day 3 (POD 3). All chest drains were removed subsequently, and laboratory work was within normal limits. Predischarge transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no significant changes, and the patient was planned to be discharged home on POD 6 in satisfactory condition.","[[15.0, 'year']]",F,"['6373508-1', '6373508-2', '6340237-1']","['19401719', '11576420', '30474613', '16085695', '102106', '21730323', '10463276', '4064367', '30745636', '8914733', '3777971', '24443027', '12383097', '21221114', '8914740', '24913064', '3669050', '34925973']"

She had initially noticed a painless mass in her right maxillary premolar region in 2002. After she had first noticed of the mass, it grew gradually in size, but she sought no treatment for it. She was referred to us for examination and treatment because it was difficult to perform tracheal intubation for surgery of sigmoid colon cancer at another hospital. Her history included sigmoid colon cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhaging, bronchitic asthma, and cardiac insufficiency. Regarding the intra- and extra-oral findings, a massive pedunculated mass in the right maxillary premolar region measuring 83 × 58 × 35 mm was palpable (Fig. ). Furthermore, it covered the front of the right palate, and it protruded to the extra-oral region from the right maxillary premolar alveolar region. Its surface was almost entirely smooth, and some erosions and ulcerations were seen. It was elastic and hard and showed no tenderness on palpation. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy, and a laboratory examination revealed no abnormal values.
Panoramic X-ray revealed the shadow of the mass in the right maxillary premolar region, which included some hard tissue (Fig. ). Computed tomography (CT) showed scattering calcified images in the mass (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging was not performed because she had vertebral artery clips and screws in her forehead. Given the above findings, we suspected benign gingival tumor in the right maxillary premolar region and performed a biopsy under local anesthesia (Fig. a, b).
Histologically, proliferation of dysplastic squamous epithelia was observed (Fig. ). We noted subepithelial mild dysplastic spindle-shaped cells and collagenous fibers, and scattered calcification and ossification were also observed (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were negative for pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and nuclear translocation of β-catenin was not observed in the spindle cells (data not shown). Therefore, we excluded a diagnosis of carcinosarcoma and fibromatosis. However, we were unable to diagnose absolutely whether the dysplastic squamous epithelia were pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia of the gingiva or well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) revealed that the maximum standard unit value (SUVmax) of the sigmoid colon and the oral lesion were 15.27 and 14.99, respectively, and there were no other obvious metastases (Fig. ). Therefore, we performed tumorectomy under general anesthesia. The pedicle of the tumor was located at the right maxillary premolar area, and the tumor—including the tissue surrounding the lesion—was resected as one mass together with the periosteum (Fig. a–d). At that time, partial destruction of the maxillary bone was seen. The exposed bone surface was slightly curetted. After resection, the wounded area was covered with artificial dermis (TERDERMIS). Finally, tie-over dressing by gauze with ointment was performed.
The microscopic findings of the surgically removed tumor were similar to those of the biopsy specimen. The body of the tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells that were proliferating with collagenous fiber, and scattered bone formation was also observed (Fig. ). The destruction of the basement membrane by atypical squamous epithelia was observed in the surgically removed specimen, suggesting stromal invasion. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the dysplastic squamous epithelia were positive for Ki67 and CK17, suggesting that they were squamous cell carcinoma, not pseudocarcinomatous hyperplasia. Furthermore, some spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle action (SMA), indicating myofibroblastic differentiation. Therefore, the epithelial component of the tumor was considered to be well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Because most of the tumor was occupied by spindle-shaped cells and marked ossification histopathologically, we diagnosed the tumor as POF with squamous cell carcinoma (pT1N0M0).
One week after surgery, we removed the gauze and covered the wound with an oral appliance for protection (Fig. a, b). There have been no signs of local recurrence or metastasis during follow-up as of 2 years after surgery.","[[83.0, 'year']]",F,"['3361788-1', '3556846-1', '3556846-2', '3556846-3', '3556846-4', '5844686-1', '3100863-1']","['11495143', '22690061', '17220623', '31601435', '22337469', '19000465', '31490037', '2120653', '22215935', '23857548', '22310455', '7776054', '6750498', '17463105', '17263149', '21760674', '5223950', '23365762', '11447957', '29563937', '20339239', '14827538', '2926546', '19325214', '21985885', '3477764', '34922609']"

Physical therapy started immediately after ICU admission. We found a highly dyspneic patient with a high breathing frequency and significant symptom exacerbation from the slightest effort. With hands-on physical therapy guidance, the patient managed to achieve a 135° prone position and to perform deep-breathing exercises resulting in an increase in oxygen saturation from 88% to 96%. Intensive physical therapy and positioning was continued along with 6 to 12 L/min of oxygen therapy over the next days and intubation was avoided. The major challenges in achieving a prone position were the patient’s profoundly reduced respiratory capacity and the high risk of exacerbating his symptoms. However, standard ICU monitoring enabled safe implementation at an individually adapted pace to allow sufficient time for convalescence. After 3 days with this regime, he could be transferred to the normal ward, where physical therapists carried on his rehabilitation with walking and strength training. The patient’s severe instability remained a challenge.

Initially, he was able to exercise and sit in a chair with a physical therapist, but progressive respiratory failure necessitated intubation and proning. The patient had large amounts of bronchial mucus and required regular suctioning along with respiratory therapy. Secretions were assessed with pulmonary auscultation (presence of crackles) and by analyzing expiratory flow on the ventilator (sawtooth pattern). When suctioning failed to improve these clinical signs, 1 to 2 physical therapists used manual airway clearance techniques. The goal of these techniques was to sufficiently increase expiratory flow for effective airway clearance while avoiding alveolar collapse. To achieve this, manual compressions on the chest and abdomen were performed with just enough intensity to modify expiratory flow. After extubation, the patient was still unable to effectively clear his mucus due to weak cough. He continued to need intensive manual airway clearance techniques, nasal rinsing to induce cough and to help expectoration as well as upper and lower airway suctioning. To this end, the patient was treated up to 6 times per day/night. Additional physical therapist interventions included passive range of motion, assisted exercising, and mobilization.

390,8718503-1,34977144,comm/PMC008xxxxxx/PMC8718503.xml,Extensive Abdominal Skin Necrosis Following Anterior Component Separation for a Large Ventral Hernia: A Case Report,"We present a case of a 58-year-old female patient with a large recurrent ventral hernia. Six years before, the patient had been operated on for the umbilical hernia, with the simple repair without a mesh. The patient was an active smoker who suffered from morbid obesity with a body mass index of 43 kg/m2 and COPD as comorbidities relevant for this case report.
The patient was introduced to the surgeon during hospitalization at the gastroenterology department where a diagnostic workup due to a clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction was conducted. While taking the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia that had intensified in the last few weeks. The physical examination revealed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen that was quite painful on palpation, but soft and, at that time, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. Taking into account the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration, the surgeon did not opt for preoperative optimization of the patient in terms of smoking cessation and starting a weight loss program but made an indication for semielective surgery.
On operative procedure, greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found as hernial content. After adhesiolysis hernial content was reduced into the abdominal cavity. Hernial defect measuring about 7 cm in diameter and about 15 cm in the vertical line with significant rectus diastase in the supraumbilical part of the abdomen was revealed. Using the Rives-Stoppa technique a wide retromuscular space was created. Lateral dissection boundaries of this space were perforating neurovascular bundles in the area of the lateral edges of the rectus muscle on both sides. The posterior fascia was easily closed using also a portion of the hernia sac to bridge the defect between the posterior rectus sheaths. A 30 × 25 cm polypropylene mesh was placed in the retromuscular space ensuring adequate mesh overlap over the edges of the hernia defect of a minimum of 5 cm in all directions.
When we observed that the anterior fascia, due to the size of the defect and decreased abdominal wall elasticity, would not close entirely and cover the mesh, we opted for rectus mobilization by the ACS method to avoid bridging. Upon extensive dissection of the anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous space without preservation of the rectus perforator vessels, relaxing incisions of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis were performed. Using the Ramirez technique, long longitudinal incisions of aponeurosis were made bilaterally, adjacently to the semilunar line, extending from the costal arch to the groin. This procedure resulted in the considerable mobilization of the vital musculofascial flap medially, and the hernial defect was closed at the midline without tension. Then, four redon drains were placed, i.e., 2 in the retrorectus space and another 2 in the subcutaneous space.
The postoperative course was complicated by skin ischemia. Ischemic lesions of the abdominal wall skin on the right with signs of necrosis along the midline were observed already on day 8 (). On postoperative day 11, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) of the abdomen was performed because of the ever more abundant wound discharge. MSCT findings showed a large subcutaneous seroma, a normal musculofascial component of the abdominal wall, appropriate mesh position, and normal intra-abdominal status. Percutaneous puncture of seroma was performed and about 800 ml of clear seroma was evacuated. During the next 10 days, ischemia progressed, along with the development of another two full-thickness skin necrotic foci paramedially (). Considering the relatively strict demarcation area of necrosis, we opted for the operative procedure of necrosectomy.
Following abdominal wall necrosectomy with a safety margin of healthy tissue and considering an appropriate amount of vital residual abdominal skin, as well as the absence of signs of local tissue infection or mesh infection, primary wound closure was performed in consultation with a plastic surgeon (). As early as day 4 of the second operation, increased wound discharge and signs of skin wound dehiscence occurred, which required removal of skin sutures (). Then, a wound dressing with a hypertonic solution was applied for a week.
When inflammation subsided, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with the “Renasis Ez Max VAC® system” (Smith & Nephew, Mississauga, Canada) was initiated (). NPWT was delivered in continuous mode with negative pressure maintained at −100 mm Hg. Dressing in the form of a sponge of polyurethane black hydrophobic foam was changed every third day. After 2 weeks of NPWT administration, considerable improvement was recorded in wound cleaning and formation of healthy granulation tissue (). NPWT was continued for the next 2 months, which resulted in further improvement of condition of the patient, along with decreased wound discharge and cavity reduction. The wound swab obtained twice during dressing change was sterile. The patient was discharged from the hospital and regular changing of silver-impregnated antimicrobial wound dressing (Aquacel Ag, ConvaTec, Reading, United Kingdom) was continued in ambulatory care that led to complete wound closure in 7 months ().","[[58.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['13923961', '17372669', '31384234', '19495920', '329161', '2683400', '2143588', '25380560', '14715576', '34053913', '26423675', '4277952', '12089832', '15723151', '31916607', '24281948', '20304452', '12045549', '29053405', '6233733', '31034574', '26966814', '18053931', '32207571', '31358348', '34977144']"

His disease, diagnosed at age 8 years, manifested with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic molluscum contagiosum, and eczematous dermatitis. Recent complications included diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) 4 months pre-HSCT. Treatment with rituximab (4 doses) and LMB regimen (, ) (2 cycles), including vincristine, doxorubicin, corticosteroids, methotrexate and with cumulative cyclophosphamide dose of 3300 mg/m2 as per ANHL1131, Group B (R-COPADM), was complicated by chemotherapy-associated grade III BKV-HC managed with cidofovir and 2 infusions of third-party donor-derived quadrivalent anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV), -Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), -adenovirus (ADV), and -BK virus specific T-cells (VSTs) at 5x107 cells/m2 (NCT02532452) (). VSTs were well tolerated without any infusion reaction. HC symptoms subsequently resolved while asymptomatic BK viremia persisted. Achieving a complete remission, he proceeded to HSCT with his father as the haploidentical bone marrow donor. Reduced intensity (RIC) conditioning was comprised of fludarabine 30 mg/m2 x 5 days (days -6 to -2), busulfan dosed with target area under the curve (AUC) of 3600-4000 uM.min/day x 3 days (days -4 to -2), cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg x 2 days (days -6 and -5), and low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 200 cGy) on day -1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was comprised of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy) on days +3 and + 4 along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) x 30 days and tacrolimus x 6 months, both of which started on day +5 (). Mild cystitis without hematuria developed on HSCT day 0. BK viremia simultaneously increased from 588,844 copies/mL (3 days pre-HSCT) to 6,456,542 copies/mL on day +4 ().
His immediate post-HSCT course was complicated by gross hematuria and painful bladder spasms with PT/Cy (50 mg/kg) on days +3 and +4. Grade IV gross hematuria, managed with daily blood product transfusions, persisted alongside worsening acute kidney injury (AKI, day +14) (). Continued transfusion dependence led to significant fluid retention and 11 kg weight gain over 11 days. Daily platelet infusions were used to maintain platelet count ≥ 30 K/mcL, and platelet engraftment ≥ 50 K/mcL was not attained. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved at day +21; chimerism studies demonstrated 100% donor-derived cells without evidence of GVHD.
Progressive hydronephrosis and hydroureter prompted Foley catheter and bilateral nephrostomy tube placement by day +30. Gross hematuria from the left nephrostomy tube occasioned left renal arteriography which revealed active bleeding unrelated to the nephrostomy at multiple sites and features suggestive of vasculitis. Coil embolization performed on two separate occasions (days +35 and +38) provided only transient stabilization. Ongoing bleeding and transfusion needs were accompanied by increasing total and direct hyperbilirubinemia (2.9 mg/dL and 2.7 mg/dL, respectively (day +43)). Complete left renal artery embolization on day +42, followed by initiation of intravenous cidofovir (), stabilized the patient for transport to receive an additional infusion of third-party VSTs (day +43) produced using the same donor as his second pre-HSCT infusion (NCT02532452). BK viremia measured 5,754,399 copies/mL at third infusion, nearly a full log increase from viral load with pre-transplant VSTs ().
Two days after VST infusion (day +45), onset of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was evidenced by fever, hypotension, worsening lung opacities, and bilateral pleural effusions. Inflammatory markers indicative of CRS were also elevated. CRP peaked at 268.7 mg/L on day +43 following VST infusion. Interestingly, CRP had been rising in the days leading up to VST infusion, potentially in the context of significant bleeding and interventional procedures. A rapid rise in ferritin was seen from 4,641 mcg/mL pre-VSTs (day +40) to 5,313 mcg/mL post-infusion (day +45) and 17,456 mcg/mL on day +47 (). Plasma IL-6 rose from 360 pg/mL pre-infusion (day +41) to 2,182 pg/mL on day +45 with CRS onset and prior to initiation of the IL-6R (receptor) blocker tocilizumab (). Concurrent blood, urine, and viral testing remained negative for any signs of new infection. Aggressive fluid resuscitation, bilateral chest tube placement, vasopressor support, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and 4 doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg) were given over 48 hours. Following fluid resuscitation for CRS, liver studies (day +47) demonstrated worsening hyperbilirubinemia. Liver ultrasound showed hepatosplenomegaly and sluggish flow through the main portal vein, raising concern for late-onset sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)/veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Given prior life-threatening hemorrhage, defibrotide was contraindicated. Multiorgan failure and worsening coagulopathy led to hypoxic arrest on day +63. Autopsy was declined but limited postmortem single core liver, kidney, and lung biopsies demonstrated hepatic SOS/VOD with zone 3 hemorrhagic necrosis, acute renal tubular injury, and early pulmonary exudative phase diffuse alveolar damage (). Limited tissue SV40 immunostain for polyomavirus was negative at all 3 sites.","[[16.0, 'year']]",M,"['5036119-1', '5036119-2']","['22940833', '33929874', '27113444', '30565250', '17325885', '20947805', '26920464', '30391550', '11680445', '25627830', '19776401', '25636378', '17132719', '29388318', '18540939', '33216887', '27683628', '28288951', '31942610', '31021819', '27130861', '33264547', '30907978', '24418481', '31851312', '34975916']"

Treatment was continued VRC and IPI, and changed to teicoplanin (TEC, 400 mg, daily, intravenous injection) as antibacterial and antifungal drugs Treatment was changed to voriconazole (VRC) and imipenem as antifungal and antibacterial methods after a positive result for the test of (1,3)- β-D-glucan (100.70 pg/mL, Guangzhou Zhaokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd) on day 22. However, the fever was unresponsive and the lesions in the brain and lung were more serious a week later. The procalcitonin (PCT) level was elevated to 4.40 ng/mL, and c-reactive protein (CRP) reached 218.33 mg/L. Aminoleucine transferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) reached 145 U/L and 242 U/L, respectively. Other drugs were applied to protect patient's liver function. Rhizomucor miehei infection was shown by mNGS (Genskey Medical Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China. NextSeq 500) of PB with high relative abundance about 99.94% on day 25 (), and liposome-associated amphotericin B (AmBL, 100 mg, daily, intravenous injection) was immediately used as antifungal therapy from day 25 to day 55. The patient's body temperature returned to normal (36–37°C) after 3 days of treatment and his complete blood count (CBC) recovered from neutropenia on day 28. Infection with Rhizomucor miehei was also proven by mNGS both in CSF with relative abundance about 0.35% on day 28 and BAL with relative abundance about 28% on day 35 (), and the routine and biochemical examinations of CSF were negative (). After 2 and 3 weeks of antifungal treatment, CT scans showed that lesions were obviously absorbed both in the brain () and the lung (), and PCT and CRP were also recovered following antifungal therapy (). Finally, the patient's general condition improved, and his right limb function partly recovered on day 55. He requested to go back to the local hospital to continue antifungal therapy due to his family reasons.
After 2 months of follow-up by telephone, we learned that patient changed to receive antifungal treatment with amphotericin B (AmB, 150 mg, daily, intravenous injection) and posaconazole (Pos, 300 mg, daily, orally) for other 2 months, because patient's liver had recovered to normal function. Besides, significant reduction in the size of the lesions on imaging tests of this patient were reported. The next chemotherapy for ALL was also prepared to carried out. The antifungal drug regimen was well-tolerated and achieved a remarkable effect.","[[44.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['10071269', '27923750', '10386506', '22247446', '15776383', '26450170', '22247442', '7811856', '29074157', '16080086', '15287935', '30423048', '6275695', '34176206', '10961535', '33409328', '30415043', '26433313', '7734347', '16517858', '9168721', '30918369', '9375750', '24957094', '17999877', '2512157', '21508149', '18611163', '34631726', '26722589', '34977080']"

One day later, he was hospitalized with exertional dyspnea. He was diagnosed with pneumonia that developed into moderate ARDS needing mechanical ventilation and intermittent dialysis. After extubation, oxygenation was stable with 2 to 3 L/min of oxygen. However, the patient was disoriented and could not communicate verbally. His global weakness (CPAx 11/50) was accompanied by oral and pharyngeal weakness and paresthesia. Spontaneous swallowing frequency and tongue control were severely reduced, and the patient showed insufficient protection from aspiration. This was confirmed by a specialized physical therapist with the Gugging Swallowing Screen, which confirmed severe dysphagia with 2/20 points. He was treated nil by mouth and received dysphagia therapy such as intensive oral stimulation, facilitation of swallowing, and training of protection mechanisms. After initial agitation and disorientation, the patient started to communicate in single-word phrases, but dysphagia continued to be severe with massive oral and pharyngeal dry saliva residuals that compromised his paresthesia and required regular mouth care. Over the next days, the patient managed to swallow pureéd food and mildly thick fluids under supervision, although cough strength was still weak (Gugging Swallowing Screen 13/20, CPAx 30/50). Nevertheless, he continued to progress and became capable of independent food ingestion (Gugging Swallowing Screen 20/20, CPAx 39/50) before his discharge to a rehabilitation clinic 25 days after admission.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,"['7665777-1', '7665777-2', '7665777-3', '7665777-4', '7665777-5', '7665777-7', '7665777-8', '7665777-9', '7665777-10', '7665777-11']","['32320506', '32293716', '23219649', '30339549', '17470624', '32280973', '34789437', '30427933', '32191813', '31064802', '12493078', '23688302', '24552321', '34602603', '29208005', '32312646', '20046114', '32250385', '23886842', '32345343', '17885261', '29023260', '27940276', '31768568', '34953756', '30113379', '28847238', '33492400']"
426,6000971-1,29898699,comm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6000971.xml,Rapid calcium loss may cause arrhythmia in hemofiltration with regional citrate anticoagulation: a case report,"A 51-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Nephrology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China) in June 2016 because of hypercalcemia and renal failure. The patient was well until he developed persistent leg and low back pain 20 days before admission. Prior testing at a local hospital showed progressive abnormal renal function (serum creatinine, 304.2 μmol/L), a high serum calcium level (4.86 mmol/L), and an extremely high level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1551 ng/L; reference level, 12–88 ng/L). After hydration with saline and diuresis with loop diuretics and hemodialysis, the patient was transferred to our hospital. He had no unusual issues with the exception of a 1-year history of stage 3 chronic kidney disease.
On admission, the patient reported fatigue, bone pain, and polyuria. A physical examination on admission revealed blood pressure of 119/80 mmHg and heart rate of 71 beats per min, but no specific findings of the lymph nodes, head, neck, heart, lung, abdomen, or joints. Laboratory testing revealed corrected serum calcium of 3.39 mmol/L, phosphorus of 0.84 mmol/L, PTH of 540 ng/mL, serum creatinine of 151 μmol/L (after hemodialysis), and hemoglobin of 120 g/L. Urine calcium was 9.2 mmol/24 h. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete right bundle branch block and a precordial abnormal ST segment and normal corrected QT (QTc) interval (Fig. ). Myocardial marker analysis showed serum myoglobin of 31 μg/L and high-sensitivity troponin T of 826 ng/L. Ultrasonography revealed a nodule at the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland. Single-photon emission computed tomography results indicated an adenoma of the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland. Due to no family history of such disease and no medication history of thiazide or lithium, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism caused by a parathyroid adenoma was made. Because of the high level of troponin T and changes to the ST segment on an ECG, acute myocardium injury was considered, thus parathyroidectomy was deferred for multidisciplinary consultation. The final diagnoses were hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid adenoma, acute renal injury, chronic kidney disease, and acute myocardium injury.
Hydration with 3000 mL of fluid [60% saline (0.9%) and 40% dextrose (5%)] per day, furosemide at 40 mg three times per day, cinacalcet at 25 mg per day, and RRT were utilized to reduce serum calcium levels. Double lumen catheterization of the right femoral vein was used for vascular access. Slow extended dialysis with low-calcium dialysate (1.25 mmol) at bedside was started using a commercially available continuous RRT device (multiFiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). The dialysate flow was 4800 mL/h for 8 h each session. Changes in serum corrected calcium levels are shown in Fig. . Due to an unsatisfactory lowering of serum calcium and preparation for parathyroidectomy, slow extended dialysis was switched to 8-h RCA-predilutional hemofiltration at a replacement rate of 4300 mL/h. The replacement solution was prepared by a local pharmacy (Na, 105 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 21.5 mmol/L; zero calcium; magnesium, 0.5 mmol/L; and glucose, 6.7 mmol/L). The infusion rate of 4% trisodium citrate (citrate dose 4.2 mmol/L) was 220 mL/h and the blood flow was 120 mL/min when hematocrit was 32%.
Given the time limit of treatment, we gradually reduced the rate of calcium supplementation from 5.6 to 2.2 mmol/h in the first session of RCA-hemofiltration (Fig. ). The post-filter ionized calcium was 0.34–0.53 mmol/L during RCA-hemofiltration. The corrected serum calcium level decreased from 3.5 to 3.2 mmol/L and ionized calcium decreased from 1.97 to 1.67 mmol/L. This result was not inspiring, despite estimated 30 mmol calcium loss during RCA-hemofiltration.
A lower infusion rate of calcium (1.1 mmol/h) was started at the second session of RCA-hemofiltration (Fig. ). However, chest discomfort and palpitations were reported by the patient after treatment for 15 min. At that time, his blood pressure was 110/64 mmHg and heart rate was 125 beats per min. Blood gas analysis showed potassium of 3.8 mmol/L and a rapid serum ionized calcium decrease (from 1.91 mmol/L to 1.71 mmol/L). Hence, calcium supplementation immediately increased to 5.6 mmol/h and 2 min later, the chest discomfort and palpitation disappeared. However, the 12-lead ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc interval as compared to baseline at 3 days before (Fig. and Table ). One hour later, the calcium infusion was gradually reduced to 2.2 mmol/h to reduce the level of serum calcium without inducing sinus tachycardia. The ionized calcium decreased from 1.91 to 1.61 mmol/L with unaltered corrected serum calcium.
The third RCA-hemofiltration session began at a calcium infusion rate of 2.2 mmol/h, which resulted in a decrease in corrected serum calcium from 3.5 to 2.7 mmol/L and in ionized calcium from 1.91 to 1.18 mmol/L without arrhythmia (Fig. ).
After the third RCA-hemofiltration session, high-sensitivity troponin T decreased to 89.8 ng/L and the patient was deemed sufficiently stable to undergo parathyroidectomy. An untypical parathyroid adenoma was pathologically confirmed. Postoperatively, PTH dropped to 16.9 ng/L and serum calcium dropped to 2.25 mmol/L. Serum calcium was 2.11 mmol/L and serum creatinine was 173 μmol/L at discharge. The patient received a telephone follow-up at 2 months after discharge and reported serum calcium of 2.13 mmol/L and serum creatinine of 112 μmol/L without calcium supplementation.","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['8857118', '12633817', '22476881', '18645366', '160852', '9565811', '27113697', '34513045', '25485561', '29898699']"

A core biopsy of his axillary mass revealed metastatic malignant melanoma. He had no prior history of a primary melanoma. A staging PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG uptake in his left axilla and small bowel. A left axillary lymph node dissection was performed and revealed 2 of 19 lymph nodes involved with metastatic melanoma, BRAF wild type, the largest of which measured 10.1 cm. His medical history was significant for oligodendroglioma, which was surgically resected eight years prior to presentation, followed by radiation therapy for recurrence five years prior to presentation. He received four doses of systemic ipilimumab for his metastatic melanoma without incident. Post-treatment imaging revealed disease progression with new diffuse subcutaneous, lung, liver and bilateral axillary lymph node metastases.
He subsequently enrolled on a genetically engineered T-cell trial, targeting tyrosinase. He received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide as a conditioning regimen, then his engineered T-cells were infused, followed by one week of low dose IL-2, (72,000 U/kg IV q8 hours). Per the treatment protocol, unfractionated creatinine kinase (CK) levels were obtained just prior to and for two weeks after infusion of the genetically engineered T-cells. The CK levels were within normal limits during the course of this treatment. He initially experienced disease response, however, four months after his T-cell therapy, he again developed diffuse progression with new hilar lymphadenopathy and progression of his lung and axillary lymph node metastases.
He was next treated with three doses of pembrolizumab but post-treatment imaging again revealed disease progression in his lungs. CK levels were not checked during treatment with either ipilumumab or pembrolizumab. Despite multiple lines of therapy, the patient continued to have an excellent performance status, so he thus proceeded to treatment with HD IL-2 (600,000 IU/kg IV over 15 min every 8 h day 1–5 and day 15–19), which began nine months after receiving his engineered T-cell infusion.
During cycle one of course 1 (day 1–5) of HD IL2, he received 10 out of 14 possible doses and experienced the expected adverse effects of hypotension, sinus tachycardia, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Serum CK was monitored per protocol and was initially normal but peaked at 641 (50–320 IU/L) during the fourth day of treatment without associated symptoms or cardiac findings on EKG.
He had an uncomplicated recovery and was re-admitted to the hospital for cycle 2 of course 1 (day 15–19) of HD IL-2, without complaints and a normal serum CK level of 133 (50–320 IU/L). After 6 doses of HD-IL2, he began to experience diffuse myalgias and rigors. He was noted to have a rapid rise in CK to 2700 and increase in his serum creatinine from 2.5 to 4.4 (0.6–1.4 mg/dL). An EKG revealed sinus tachycardia and his serum troponin level was normal at 0.02 (0.00–0.04 ng/mL). The rise in CK was attributed to rigors and he was continued on therapy. He went on to receive 2 additional doses of HD IL-2. When his CK rose further to 3900 and the myalgias became more severe despite resolution of his rigors, subsequent doses were held.
Further investigation revealed an elevated serum aldolase of 32.7 (1.2–7.6 U/L), and elevated urine myoglobin of 132 (< 28 mcg/L). MB fractionation of CK was not performed. Urinalysis demonstrated large blood without red blood cells. Serial EKGs demonstrated sinus tachycardia but not sequelae of hyperkalemia, such as peaked T waves. Other labs for serologic autoimmunity, e.g. anti-nuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA anti-striated muscle antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody, were not checked. Muscle function was not assessed with electromyography (EMG). He received supportive care and aggressive intravenous hydration with normal saline. He recovered fully from this episode of rhabdomyolysis.
Subsequent staging with a PET/CT revealed a mixed response in his pulmonary nodules with mild improvement in his hilar and axillary lymphadenopathy. Given his full recovery from previous toxicity and the mixed response on imaging, the decision was made to proceed with a second course of HD-IL2 therapy with close monitoring of CK levels and a low threshold for discontinuation of therapy.
He received only two doses of HD IL-2 and again developed diffuse myalgias with a rapid rise in his serum CK level from 184 to 1680. Serum aldolase and urine myoglobin were again significantly elevated, at 16.2 and 3430, respectively. All further doses of HD IL-2 were held and he was again supported with aggressive intravenous hydration. His clinical symptoms resolved and his CK level trended down to the normal range.
Due to this unusual toxicity, a muscle biopsy was performed to further evaluate for rhabdomyolysis and to ascertain if his engineered T-cells were present in his muscle tissue. The biopsy revealed rare myofiber necrosis and myophagocytosis and scant endomysial infiltrate. The infiltrate consisted of a mixture of CD3 and CD4 positive T-lymphocytes, CD68 positive macrophages and lesser numbers of CD8 positive T-lymphocytes, suggestive of an immune-mediated toxicity causing necrotizing myopathy (Fig. ). It was difficult to ascertain if the T-lymphocyte present represented his engineered T-cells. Of note, the engineered T-cells remained detectable in the circulation at this time. He was discharged home and follow up PET/CT imaging revealed a near complete response. At the time of this follow up, he was found to have new onset vitiligo involving his neck, upper back, chest, and upper arms (Fig. ). A skin biopsy at the edge of his neck vitiligo again revealed CD3+ T-cell infiltration (Fig. ).
No further HD-IL2 therapy has been administered and he continues to experience a durable response on imaging nearly two and a half years since completion of his HD IL-2 therapy. Of note, CK levels had not been checked when the patient had received prior therapy with ipilumumab or pembrolizumab. CK levels were, however, monitored at the time of treatment with engineered T-cells and were noted to be within the reference range.","[[42.0, 'year']]",M,"['4915058-1', '5671695-1']","['22658127', '25891304', '28494274', '25891173', '25265494', '28654547', '8630901', '27935327', '23724867', '25399551', '9048796', '27330809', '26014293', '29312452', '10685652', '27714434', '22735384', '11533109', '20525992', '10561265', '25667295', '23724846', '26027431', '21639808', '8625165', '22356324', '29898784']"

Imaging findings on enhanced computed tomography (CT) and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed two tumors located in segments 5 and 8, respectively (Figs. and ). Although the alpha-fetoprotein level was within the reference range, the serum level of prothrombin induced by the absence of vitamin K or antagonist-II was high (530 mAU/ml). After a preoperative evaluation based on a three-dimensional (3D) imaging study, anterior segmentectomy was performed. Each branch of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and biliary duct for the anterior segment were ligated together as the Glissonean bundle (so-called, fully simultaneous transection of the Glissonean pedicle [FSTG]) (Fig. ). Perihilar FSTG involved a transfixation suture by using an absorbable thread. The tumor in segment 8 was in contact with the middle hepatic vein. However, this tumor was well-encapsulated, and the tumor and vein were easily dissectable. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 14.
Three months later, dynamic MRI was performed to check for intrahepatic recurrence, and no imaging findings of recurrence were observed. However, an arterioportal fistula and portal vein aneurysm were incidentally detected (Fig. ). Layers of old and subacute hematomas were clearly observed, and these layers surrounded the aneurysm. Surprisingly, the patient did not have subtle symptoms and showed no episodes of pain, ascites, liver dysfunction, or other abnormalities. We suspected a pseudoaneurysm at that time. Although a perfect angiographic evaluation could not be ensured, IVR was needed to avoid sudden rupture and possible death. Therefore, we decided to attempt IVR after evaluation of the vessels on dynamic CT, and transcatheter arterial embolization was proposed thereafter.
First, angiography via the celiac artery was performed. Arteriography was subsequently used to create a portogram via this APF, and portography clearly revealed hepatofugal flow of the portal vein. Portography also showed that the stump of the anterior portal vein had developed a portal vein aneurysm (PVA) with a diameter of 40 mm (Fig. a). Selective catheterization of the common hepatic artery was then performed. This arteriography clearly demonstrated a fistula between the hepatic artery and portal vein (i.e., APF) at the stump of the anterior branches (Fig. b). Based on these angiography findings, we definitively diagnosed PVA due to an APF, not a pseudoaneurysm.
Next, an adequate length of APF to perform embolic therapy was confirmed to avoid any occlusion and disturbance at the bifurcation of the right hepatic artery (Fig. b). Selective embolization of the anterior hepatic artery was then accomplished by placing several titanium coils in the whole length of the stump of the anterior hepatic artery. Finally, the flow of blood through the APF was drastically reduced (Fig. c). Arteriography via the superior mesenteric artery showed a remarkable restoration of portal venous flow, and hepatopetal portal flow was clearly observed (Fig. d).
Complete closure of the APF could be estimated by additional expansion of the metallic coils over time after IVR. Dynamic CT and 3D images 3 days after embolization clearly demonstrated perfect interruption of the APF and disappearance of the PVA (Fig. ).
Imaging studies and serum biomarkers showed no evidence of recurrence. At the time of this study, the patient was good in health and had been reintegrated into society.","[[62.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['10631729', '21353459', '25717263', '27984211', '28533669', '28784937', '9322535', '29410393', '22875308', '28099460', '16627220', '3952673', '17878703', '27498301', '8574060', '24045452', '20832560', '8239193', '28480187', '29904893']"

Moderate ARDS with reduced lung compliance was diagnosed and treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning.
On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, while she was still intubated and under pressure support ventilation. SOEB required 3 physical therapists to maintain the position, but resulted in a significant increase in her level of consciousness and collaborative state. The next day, she was able to hold her head and sit for about 15 minutes with 2 therapists. Her muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60; still she continued with small but consistent improvements and started to participate actively in physical therapy sessions. She was encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity and was actively transferred to a chair each day with the help of 2 physical therapists. She was successfully extubated, but presented postextubation dysphagia. The physical therapy team closely monitored her for secretion management and cough stimulation and continued her physical rehabilitation. On day 19, she started to walk with a walking aid, although at this point oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident (89% with 3 L/min of oxygen).

The animal had been transferred from another institution 4 weeks prior to presentation with a history of osteoarthritis at the left intertarsal joint and an asymptomatic systolic heart murmur. Laxity and varus deviation of the distal left hindlimb at the intertarsal joint were first observed 2 years prior to presentation at the animal's previous institution. It had also been treated for several previous episodes of bilateral pododermatitis.
Several days after transfer into a new enclosure, the animal began to exhibit intermittent non-weight-bearing left hindlimb lameness and was prescribed tramadol (5.5 mg/kg bodyweight (BW) orally twice daily) for pain management. The animal failed to sufficiently respond to this treatment over the course of 1 month and began spending increased time in a sternal position or on the ground of the enclosure. Under general anesthesia with isoflurane gas and oxygen, a physical examination with radiographs, complete blood count, and plasma biochemistry was performed to evaluate the lameness. Physical examination revealed firm periarticular enlargement, reduced range of motion, subluxation, and dynamic varus deviation at the left intertarsal joint (). No evidence of pododermatitis was observed at either foot. Orthogonal view radiographs of the pelvic limbs revealed muscle atrophy of the left hindlimb, moderate soft-tissue expansion around the left intertarsal joint with an uneven joint space that was widened at its lateral and narrowed at its medial aspects on the dorsoplantar radiographic view, and evidence of degenerative joint disease at this joint (). A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry were considered unremarkable when compared to species reference values []. The chronic degenerative joint disease and instability likely associated with previous joint ligament or tendon rupture was thought to be the underlying cause of the lameness. The animal was prescribed meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg BW orally once daily) and continued on tramadol. A visual evaluation performed 2 weeks later revealed continued intermittent lameness of the left hindlimb with reduced weight-bearing and frequent placement of the limb in an abnormal extended position. Gabapentin (3 mg/kg BW orally once daily) was prescribed for additional pain management; however, progressive lameness of the left hindlimb persisted despite these conservative management efforts. Reevaluation was performed 10 weeks later when the animal was observed to be non-weight-bearing on the left hindlimb after several traumatic collisions within its enclosure. The patient was anesthetized as previously described. Physical examination findings were consistent with the animal's exam performed 10 weeks earlier, although bruising was present at the left ventral pelvic region, likely due to the recent observed collisions. Stress radiographs of the distal limbs were performed, confirming subluxation at the left intertarsal joint (). Repeated complete blood count and plasma biochemistry revealed elevated creatine kinase (1175 U/L; Species 360 database reference values 133–795) consistent with muscle damage from soft-tissue trauma or capture and handling []. A support bandage was applied to the left intertarsal joint region, and the animal's prescriptions of tramadol, meloxicam, and gabapentin were continued. Based on physical examination findings, diagnostics, and the patient's failure to respond adequately to conservative management alone, surgical stabilization of the left intertarsal joint was scheduled for the following week.
The animal was induced under general anesthesia as previously described, intubated, and maintained on isoflurane gas and oxygen throughout the surgical procedure. The left intertarsal joint was aseptically prepared, and sterile adhesive drape (Ioban™, 3M, St. Paul, USA) was applied to the limb. A 2 cm incision was made over the lateral aspect of the left intertarsal joint, and the soft-tissues were bluntly dissected from the distal tibiotarsus and proximal tarsometatarsus. A 30 ga. needle was placed into the intertarsal joint space to confirm its location, and a 2 mm drill bit was used to make an intraosseous tunnel through both cortices of the distal tibiotarsus extending proximomedially from the distolateral aspect of the metaphysis (). A second intraosseous tunnel was produced at the proximal tarsometatarsus extending distomedially from the lateral aspect of the bone. Incisions were made over the medial aspects of the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus at both exit points of the intraosseous tunnels, and soft-tissues were bluntly dissected away from the underlying bone to allow application of the stabilization implants. A flexible suture passer was used to shuttle a single strand of braided suture material (#2 Arthrex FiberWire®, Arthrex, Inc., Naples, USA) from the lateral entry points of both intraosseous tunnels to the medial exit points at both bones (). Each end of the suture material was threaded through both holes of a 2-hole titanium suture button (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL, USA) and back through its respective intraosseous tunnel to exit at the lateral aspect of the intertarsal joint. The buttons were positioned against the bones while the braided suture material was tied with the joint in a neutral position. Range of motion and varus/valgus stability of the intertarsal joint were assessed prior to tying of the suture to ensure appropriate joint stability and range of motion. Closure of the soft-tissues and skin was performed using 3-0 polydioxanone suture in a simple interrupted pattern. Postoperative radiographs revealed that the titanium button at the tarsometatarsus was positioned craniolaterally to what was considered ideal; however, the joint appeared stable during manipulation. The animal received perioperative butorphanol (2 mg/kg BW intramuscularly), meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg BW intramuscularly), clindamycin (20 mg/kg BW intravenously), enrofloxacin (15 mg/kg BW subcutaneously diluted 1 : 10 in lactated ringer's solution), and intraoperative lactated ringer's solution (10 ml/kg/hr BW intravenously). The patient continued tramadol, meloxicam, and gabapentin and was also prescribed prophylactic clindamycin (20 mg/kg BW orally once daily) and enrofloxacin (20 mg/kg BW orally once daily) for 7 days.
Initial observations made during the first 3 weeks of postoperative recovery revealed gradual initial improvement in weight-bearing with significant persistent lameness. At 5 weeks after surgery, the animal was observed spending the majority of its time in sternal recumbency with reluctance to stand, and a reevaluation with the consulting veterinary surgical specialist was scheduled for the following week. The animal was induced, intubated, and maintained under general anesthesia as previously described. Radiographs confirmed suboptimal positioning of the previously placed joint stabilization implants, and persistent subluxation of the left intertarsal joint was demonstrated in stress radiographic views (). The previous surgical stabilization was considered unsuccessful, and a second joint stabilization surgery was elected. The patient was aseptically prepared, consistent with the initial surgical procedure. Incisions were made at the medial and lateral aspects of the left intertarsal joint, and evaluation of the previously placed stabilization implants revealed that the distal titanium suture button had become unsecured from the intraosseous tunnel at the medial tarsometatarsus, leading to surgical stabilization failure and subsequent postoperative laxity at the joint. The previously placed implants were removed, and the surgical stabilization procedure was repeated similarly to what was described for the first surgical procedure. The intraosseous tunnel at the distal tibiotarsus was re-used, and the intraosseous tunnel at the proximal tarsometatarsus was evaluated, was determined to have widened, and was revised. A 1.143 mm diameter K-wire was passed from proximolateral to distomedial across the proximal tarsometatarsus. Suture material (#5 Arthrex FiberWire, Arthrex, Inc., Naples, USA) was threaded through the intraosseous bone tunnels and titanium buttons as described for the first surgery. The suture was tightened with the aid of a suture tensioner (Arthrex, Inc., Naples, FL., USA) to 5 kg, and the joint was cycled to ensure stability and range of motion. The tensioner was then removed and the suture was tied. A two-layer closure of the soft-tissues and skin was performed using 4-0 poliglecaprone suture in cruciate and simple continuous patterns. Lidocaine (1 mg/kg BW) was administered as an incisional block, postoperatively. The animal received perioperative butorphanol (0.5 mg/kg BW intramuscularly), meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg BW intramuscularly), and enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg BW subcutaneously) administered in lactated ringer's solution (40 ml/kg BW subcutaneously). Postoperative examination revealed only mild medial subluxation of the left intertarsal joint during flexion that was comparable to that observed at the contralateral limb. No significant medial subluxation was elicited with the joint in extension. Postoperative radiographs indicated appropriate positioning of the stabilization implants (). Prophylactic enrofloxacin (15 mg/kg BW orally once daily) and clindamycin (20 mg/kg BW orally once daily) were prescribed for 28 days. Meloxicam, tramadol, and gabapentin were continued as previously prescribed, and activity restriction with lowered perches was implemented for 6 weeks.
Postsurgical visual and physical evaluations were performed periodically over the next 6 months. At 3 weeks after the second surgery, the bird was noticed spending less time in sternal recumbency than following the initial surgery, although the animal continued to have noticeable lameness at the left hindlimb. A postsurgical reevaluation performed under general anesthesia at 7 weeks revealed improved medial-lateral stability at the left intertarsal joint, although the animal continued to exhibit lameness at the left hindlimb. At 14 weeks following the second surgery, the animal was observed perching normally with good weight-bearing on both hindlimbs. Only slight intermittent favouring of the left hindlimb was observed during ambulation. Due to clinical improvement, the animal was weaned from gabapentin at 20 weeks without any increase in lameness or time spent in sternal recumbency but was maintained on tramadol and meloxicam for management of chronic pain related to the animal's underlying degenerative joint disease. At 6 months following the second surgery, the animal was using the limb well during perching and ambulation with only mild occasional favouring of the limb observed.
Periodic examinations, observations, and reports from animal caretakers indicated overall improvement in the animal's mobility and use of the limb for several years following the second surgical stabilization and ongoing treatment with pain medications. Only mild occasional lameness of the left hindlimb was observed during this time. Three years after the second surgical stabilization was performed, the animal developed a more pronounced lameness. Evaluation of the animal at this time revealed radiographic progression of degenerative joint disease at the left intertarsal joint, although no change in joint stability was noted. A complete blood count and plasma biochemistry were considered unremarkable when compared to species reference values []. The animal's medications were adjusted with meloxicam administered at 1 mg/kg BW orally twice daily and tramadol at 10 mg/kg BW orally twice daily. The animal responded positively to this change and was maintained on these medications to better manage the chronic pain associated with the condition.","[[32.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['28644089', '27493284', '15122139', '22777625', '25867660', '24641357', '18307504', '25815572', '11862832', '20740260', '20345535', '24708485', '29955432']"
489,6005289-1,29955424,comm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6005289.xml,Hiccup-Like Response in a Dog Anesthetized with Isoflurane,"An eight-year-old, female intact Golden Retriever, weighing 27 kg, was referred for investigation of urinary and faecal incontinence, which acutely appeared following two months of chronic vaginal discharge. The latter partially responded to antibiotic treatment. After neurological consultation, the animal was scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar-sacral region under general anesthesia.
On preanesthetic examination the dog appeared slightly nervous but in good physical condition (ASA II). The heart rate was 90 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate was 15 breaths per minute (brpm), pulse quality was good, mucous membranes were pink, and capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. Thoracic and cardiac auscultation were unremarkable, as were the results of hematological and biochemical blood tests.
After a mild sedation was achieved administering methadone intramuscularly (0.2 mg kg−1; Synastone, Auden Mckenzie Ltd., UK), anesthesia was induced intravenously 30 minutes later with fentanyl (3 μg kg−1; Sublimaze, Janssen-Cilag Ltd., UK) and propofol (2.5 mg kg−1; Rapinovet, Schering-plough Animal Health UK). The trachea was intubated with a cuffed tube; the cuff was inflated; intubation was unremarkable. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (IsoFlo, Abbott Laboratoires, UK) in 100% oxygen, delivered through a circle system. Monitoring consisted of capnography, measurement of inspired and expired anesthetic gases and oxygen, measurement of noninvasive arterial blood pressure (Datex AS3, Helsinki, Finland), and esophageal stethoscope.
Shortly after commencement of isoflurane administration, a gasping breathing pattern was noted, with a respiratory rate of 40–50 brpm and jerk movements of the mouth and all four limbs. Heart rate was 140 bpm. Inadequate depth of anesthesia was considered the cause of the observed movements; thus ventilation was assisted manually (15 brpm) and the vaporizer setting was increased from 2% to 3% (oxygen 3 L min−1) in order to deepen the anesthetic plane. Further, a bolus of fentanyl (1 μg kg−1) was administered intravenously. At that time, end-expiratory carbon dioxide tension (PE′CO2) was 22 mmHg. Because the respiratory pattern did not change during the following 10 minutes, and suspecting an underlying pulmonary disease, MRI was cancelled while thoracic radiographs and an arterial blood gases analysis were performed. Radiographs were unremarkable and alkalemia due to primary respiratory alkalosis was apparent in the arterial blood gases analysis results (). The dog was allowed to recover from general anesthesia. Once the vaporizer was turned off and the breathing system flushed with oxygen, the dog's breathing pattern improved and became normal. The recovery from general anesthesia was uneventful. MRI was rescheduled for the following day.
On day 2, preanesthetic assessment was unremarkable and similar to that obtained the previous day. Dexmedetomidine (1.25 µg kg−1 Dexdomitor, Orion Pharma, Finland) and methadone (0.25 mg kg−1) were administered slowly intravenously. The resulting sedative effect was good with the animal relaxed in lateral recumbency. Anesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5 mg kg−1) and, after intubation of the trachea with a cuffed tube, maintained with isoflurane (vaporizer setting was 3%) in 100% oxygen at the flow of 3 L min−1, delivered through a circle system. Also in this occasion tracheal intubation was unremarkable.
As on day 1, the animal started gasping and jerking continuously as soon it was connected to the breathing system. At that point, isoflurane was immediately turned off and the breathing system flushed with pure oxygen. Anesthesia was then maintained with a constant rate infusion (CRI) of propofol (0.3 mg kg−1 min−1), after slow administration of a loading dose (0.5 mg kg−1). As the animal's breathing pattern did not improve, atracurium (0.2 mg kg−1, Tracrium Injection, GlaxoSmithKline, UK) was administered intravenously and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (Penlon Nuffield 200 ventilator) was started to maintain eucapnia (PE′CO2 35–45 mmHg). Respiratory rate was set to 15 breathes per minute, tidal volume was 300 mL, and peak inspiratory pressure was 12 cmH2O. The rest of the anesthetic time was uneventful, but it was necessary to top up atracurium every 15–20 minutes, because hiccups restarted as soon as neuromuscular function started returning.
An extensive invasive sacrococcygeal neoplasia was found on MRI. The owner decided to euthanize the dog but declined postmortem examination.","[[8.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['5412887', '9691876', '13689457', '2149003', '4738205', '15310374', '2538761', '4451261', '15479336', '2482885', '14568113', '2868032', '7758557', '1217700', '7970214', '6751158', '7636760', '8491309', '12173229', '14742368', '8063646', '8434775', '5490279', '7351583', '12650496', '29955424']"

He consulted a general physician for further evaluations and had been referred to us because plain CT confirmed multiple tumors, including a giant tumor, in the liver. A laboratory workup on admission showed that total bilirubin (0.6 mg/dL) and albumin (4.2 g/dL) concentrations were within their normal ranges, whereas aspartate aminotransferase (37 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (70 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (176 U/L), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (170 IU/L) concentrations were mildly increased. Tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein (2.9 ng/ml), protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (11 mAU/ml), and carcinoembryonic antigens 19-9 (4.0 IU/L), were within normal limits.
Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed well-defined, hypo echoic masses in segment 1 (S1) (67 × 53 mm in diameter), S6 (13 mm), and S2 (9 mm) in the liver (Fig. –). Abdominal dynamic CT revealed a low-density 65-mm diameter mass with an irregular margin in plain, peripheral early ring enhancement in the arterial phase, and internal heterogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase (Fig. –). Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic response imaging (EOB-MRI) demonstrated a low-signal intensity mass on T1-weighted images. This mass contained several high-signal intensity areas on T2-weighted images. EOB-MRI also revealed a hypointense mass in the hepatobiliary phase (Fig. –). Furthermore, it showed higher intensity compared with the normal liver parenchyma on DWI with a high b value of 1000 (Fig. ). Its ADC value was 2.11 × 10−3 mm2/s (peripheral area) and 2.45 × 10−3 mm2/s (central area), and the ADC mean was 2.33 × 10−3 mm2/s. It was described as a high-intensity mass on the ADC map (Fig. ). There was no accumulation of [18F]-FDG on FDG-PET (Fig. ). Hepatic arteriography revealed hypervascular masses in S1 (65 mm in diameter), S6 (16 mm), and S2 (9 mm) of the liver, with no pooling (Fig. , ). In addition, gastroscopy and colonoscopy showed normal findings.
On the basis of these imaging findings, a preoperative diagnosis of multiple scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas characterized by abundant fibrous stroma was made, and caudate lobectomy of the liver and partial hepatectomy of S2 and S6 were performed. The resected specimen contained a 55 × 56 mm yellowish white solid mass. The cut surfaces of the tumor were elastic and soft with smooth margins (Fig. ).
Histopathological examination showed that the tumors were composed of various sized irregularly dilated vessels with some blood thrombi, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrous and hyalinized sclerotic or myxomatous stroma (Fig. , ). On immunohistochemistry staining, these vascular endothelial cells were positive for CD34, suggesting sclerosing hemangioma (Fig. ). The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged on postoperative day14. The patient gave consent for publication of details of his case.
Hemangiomas are the commonest benign hepatic tumors, being found in up to 7% of autopsies in one series []. Hemangiomas have a predilection for women in a ratio of 5:1. They are characteristically discovered incidentally during abdominal imaging in individuals aged 40 to 50 years []. Hepatic sclerosing hemangioma, first reported by Shepherd et al. in 1983 [], is a rare type of hepatic hemangioma composed of abundant acellular hyalinized tissue in which small vessels are occasionally seen. Another study reported finding them in only two of 1000 autopsies []. Hepatic sclerosing hemangiomas are caused by degenerative changes such as thrombus formation, necrosis, and scar formation in hepatic cavernous hemangiomas; however, the mechanism(s) for these degenerative changes has not yet been determined []. Makhlouf and Ishak compared the findings in sclerosed hemangioma and sclerosing hemangioma []. They asserted that recent hemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits rich in mast cells are present in sclerosing hemangiomas, whereas fibrosis, increased elastic fibers, and dystrophic or psammomatous calcifications with decreased numbers of mast cells are characteristic of sclerosed hemangiomas [].
These pathological changes can result in the radiological features on CT and MRI being atypical of hemangioma; thus, these lesions can be diagnosed as malignant tumors such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We searched for “hepatic sclerosing hemangioma” in PubMed and ICHUSHI, a bibliographic database established in 1903 and being updated by the Japan Medical Abstracts Society, and identified 41 patients, including our patient, the characteristics of which we here summarize.
Concerning imaging studies, Miyamoto et al. [] summarized the imaging findings in 41 hepatic sclerosing hemangiomas. Their average diameter was 41.8 mm, ranging from 10 to 145 mm. Abdominal US showed hyperechoic masses in 10 patients and hypoechoic masses in 14. Plain CT generally showed a low-density mass, whereas dynamic CT showed ring enhancement, resembling metastatic liver cancer or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, in 31 of 40 (78%) reported cases. MRI showed low-intensity signals in 28 of 30 (93%) reported cases on T1-weighted images and high-intensity signals in 25 of 30 (83%) reported cases on T2-weighted images. FDG-PET showed no accumulation of [18F]-FDG in six patients who underwent this procedure []. The radiological features revealed by dynamic CT and MRI resembled those of hepatic malignancies. Thus, there were indeterminate imaging features, some imaging findings pointing to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, metastatic liver cancer, or scirrhous hepatocellular carcinoma (ring enhancement, hyperintensity on T2 with hypointensity on T1 imaging). Generally, imaging findings of ring enhancement on dynamic CT is less typical of classical hepatocellular carcinoma than of metastatic liver cancer or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In recent years, there have been a small number of reports in which DWI and DWI-based ADC were successfully used to differentiate sclerosing hemangioma from liver malignancies. The ADC values for hepatic hemangiomas are reported to be higher than those of malignant liver tumors due to restricted water diffusion from high cellular density [, ]. In our case, the ADC mean was 2.33 × 10−3 mm2/s, and the mass showed higher than the normal liver parenchyma with a high b value of 1000 on DWI. It was described as a high intensity mass on an ADC map, indicating that possibility of the sclerosing hemangioma, used as a diagnostic aid to detect. FDG-PET showed no accumulation of [18F]-FDG, it suggested the possible benign character of this sclerosing hemangioma. However, it should be noticed that negative predictive value of FDG-PET for primary hepatocellular carcinoma is less than 50% with sensitivity over 80% []. Therefore, we selected hepatic resection as a first-line strategy for the management of tumors with unknown potential.
Histopathologically, the cut surfaces of our patient’s resected tumors corresponded with cross-sectional CT images; the dynamic enhancement pattern is related to the vascular spaces component and the central areas of low density on the arterial and delayed phase to the sclerotic component, which on examination were yellowish-white with many hyalinized areas with poor vessels and fibrous changes [, ]. Additionally, our patient’s serum tumor markers, including AFP and PIVKA-2, were within normal limits. If these multiple tumors had been hepatocellular carcinomas, concentrations of these markers may have been high. Thus, it also suggests that the multiple tumors were not hepatocellular carcinomas.
Confirmation of our provisional diagnosis would have required obtaining a liver biopsy. Although a fine needle biopsy can differentiate a sclerosing hemangioma from hepatocellular carcinoma, this procedure can potentially lead to rupture or seeding of hepatocellular carcinoma. Fine needle biopsies should only be performed to confirm inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma because seeding of tumor in the needle tract has been reported in 1–3% of cases []. We suspected that our patient’s lesions were scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas because of the imaging features.

501,6006242-1,29728723,comm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6006242.xml,Pushing the limits of immune-related response: a case of “extreme pseudoprogression”,"A 52 year-old Chinese man presented with gross hematuria and had a left nephrectomy done in January 2014. Pathology revealed clear cell RCC of Furhman 2 grading, with invasion of the renal vein and peri-renal fat. There were synchronous solitary right lung and right hilar lymph node metastases. Having declined high-dose interleukin-2, he was started on pazopanib in March 2014, achieving partial response. In January 2015, pazopanib was stopped and surgery was attempted for the oligometastatic disease, but the right hilar node was found to be stuck down intra-operatively. External beam radiotherapy was administered post-operatively in February 2015 to the hilar node (55 Gy in 20 fractions). In May 2015, after 4 months off anti-angiogenic therapy, there was global progression of disease with the right hilar node enlarging and new metastases appearing in multiple sites (lungs, muscle, bones). Sunitinib was started (May to September 2015), and the patient went on to receive further lines of drug treatment with everolimus (October 2015 to February 2016) and axitinib (March to October 2016). He also had palliative surgery to the right radius (curettage and fixation in October 2015) and right proximal femur (curettage and bipolar hemiarthroplasty in November 2015). In November 2015, radiotherapy was also given to the right radius and femur post-operatively, to an enlarging and symptomatic scalp metastasis at the vertex, and to 4 brain metastases by gamma knife technique. Further courses of radiotherapy were given to a large lytic sacral metastasis (February to March 2016), several skin and subcutaneous tumors (May to June 2016), and the left knee (July to August 2016). In addition, subcutaneous denosumab was given as adjunctive treatment for bone metastases from October 2015 to September 2016.
In October 2016, computed tomography (CT) scan showed widespread metastases with interval progression in the skeletal muscles, liver, spleen, right kidney, right adrenal, pancreas, peritoneum, lungs and right hilar nodal mass. Apart from 3 new small cutaneous metastases, the patient did not have symptoms related to any specific organ site. He required the use of a walking aid after his previous hip surgery. Performance status was 2 by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (ECOG). There were multiple enlarging metastases within the single right kidney, but renal function was appropriate for a post-nephrectomy setting. For example, an upper pole lesion now measured 6.5 × 4.3 cm compared to 2.5 × 2.4 cm in the scan 5 months prior. In view of the florid radiologic progression and previous multiple lines of anti-angiogenic treatment, he was offered immunotherapy. Axitinib was stopped and a single dose of nivolumab at 100 mg was given within the same day.
The patient developed acute renal failure 2 weeks later with oliguria, rising creatinine and hyperkalemia. Serum creatinine rose progressively from a pre-nivolumab level of 117 μmol/L to a high of 247 μmol/L in the following 5 weeks (Fig. ). Urine sediment was not active (1 white cell and 1 red cell per high power field each, and no casts). Serum phosphate and serum creatine kinase were normal. Other blood indices showed anemia, mild hypercalcemia (2.81 mmol/L), raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Ultrasound (US) of the remaining kidney showed infiltrative renal tumors. There was no hydronephrosis and renal perfusion was good. Except for renal parenchymal tumor infiltration and inflammatory edema, no other plausible causes of acute renal failure were identified. Renal biopsy was not performed as this was a single kidney. There was clinical deterioration with development of dyspnea, back pain, edema and drop in performance status to ECOG 3. At 4 weeks from nivolumab, the subject of hemodialysis was broached but the patient declined. He also expressed his preference not to have aggressive resuscitation or intensive care unit management, and was referred to the home hospice service. Although the recent 3 new skin metastases had resolved, a non-contrasted CT at 5 weeks post-nivolumab documented worsening tumor in multiple sites: skeletal muscles, liver, spleen, pancreas, peritoneal nodules, lungs, right hilar nodal mass and other soft tissue areas. The right kidney was larger, consistent with increasing intrarenal tumor or inflammation. He was at home on expectant management for the next 4 weeks. Several visits were made by the home hospice team. Palliative medications included oral tramadol and gabapentin, and he was prepared for death.
At week 10, the patient unexpectedly walked into the clinic, having felt better a week prior. There was clinical improvement in his general condition and he reported an increase in urine output. Serum creatinine had improved to 131 μmol/L (Fig. ), ALP was normal, and serum calcium had normalized without any anti-resorptive agent. There was severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.4 g/dL) and the LDH was raised at 1019 units/L (range 250–580). Chest radiography showed improvement in the right hilar and lung shadows. Red cell transfusion was administered. At week 11, non-contrasted CT scan showed improvement in tumor status in most of the involved sites including a decreased size of the right kidney. Blood and bone marrow investigations for the anemia were consistent with immune-mediated hemolysis and oral prednisolone was started at week 13. The patient continued to improve and a contrast CT at week 20 showed dramatic improvement in tumor status. In some sites, including the kidney, essentially complete remission was seen. Serum creatinine returned close to baseline (Fig. ). Prednisolone was tapered off to complete a 3 month course with hemoglobin stabilizing at 11.3 g/dL. At 6 months post-nivolumab, the patient was doing well without further immunotherapy.
Serial CT and US images of the right kidney were analyzed (Fig. ). CT imaging showed marginal increase in kidney size from baseline to the 5 week post-nivolumab scan, and subsequent decrease at the 11 week scan when the renal function had recovered. There was no pre-nivolumab US scan, but the US scans done at 2 and 5 weeks post-nivolumab showed worsening of the renal tumor load (Fig. ). Onset of diffuse renal cortical swelling was also noted in the US at 5 weeks post-nivolumab, as demonstrated by the progressive compression and obscuration of renal medulla and sinus fat. The US changes are commensurate with the progressive worsening of renal function at these time points. A lower pole metastasis shown in the US at 2 weeks post-nivolumab was significantly larger than the corresponding lesion on the baseline contrast CT, despite the differences in imaging modality. A contrast CT at 4 months as well as an US at 6 months post-nivolumab showed decreased renal size and near complete resolution of the renal metastases.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,['8201531-1'],"['30783738', '26261262', '30100272', '27330803', '19934295', '25466943', '19249681', '33973724', '25083318', '33289356', '27604993', '31453084', '34131564', '31032286', '30670497', '27243803', '26951310', '31908886', '28271869', '27771741', '25828465', '28351930', '31155611', '33918397', '28410865', '28662232', '31149543', '29728723']"
502,6006564-1,29946481,comm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6006564.xml,Rare Clinical Entity: Metastatic malignant struma ovarii diagnosed during pregnancy – Lessons for management,"A 30-year old woman presented with two weeks of left lower quadrant discomfort during her second month of pregnancy. Ultrasound revealed a mixed cystic and solid left adnexal mass measuring 8.6 × 6.7 × 8.3 cm. Left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed early in the second trimester. Grossly, the left ovary demonstrated an intact 7.5 cm complex cystic-solid mass, with nearly half involved by a friable, tan-yellow tumor with papillary excrescences, some of which were freely floating within the cyst cavity. Histologic sections demonstrated a struma ovarii with over 50% characterized by the classic features of a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (Fig. ). The periphery of the tumor impinged on the ovarian capsule and vascular structures; however, no definitive evidence of invasion was seen on the histologic sections reviewed (Fig. -). Typical histology for an ovarian mature cystic teratoma (such as areas of squamous differentiation) were present in other areas of the tumor (Fig. ). The tumor expressed positive immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1, Fig. ), but was negative for BRAF V600E. Serum Tg was 83.5 ng/mL (reference range for euthyroid status in nonpregnant adults 0–35 ng/mL) seven days after surgical resection of the ovarian mass. The elevated Tg level is reasonably expected given the proximity to surgery and Tg half-life of 65 h [] and the known increase in Tg levels during pregnancy [, ]. Thyroid function tests (TSH 1.66 mU/L) and thyroid ultrasound were normal. Levothyroxine (L-T4) was started to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to 0.1–0.5 mU/L although TSH ranged 0.86–1.41 mU/L during pregnancy. After delivery, Tg was 2.9 ng/mL (TSH 0.57 mU/L). With thyroglobulin levels in a reasonable range as above, the risk of additional studies during pregnancy in terms of radiation or hypothyroid exposure, unknown risk of metastatic disease, and unknown incremental benefit of intervention during pregnancy, the decision was made to delay further testing and therapy until after delivery. Two months after delivery, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy to permit evaluation for metastatic disease and monitoring for recurrence by Tg levels. The thyroid pathology was benign.
Several months after delivery and cessation of lactation, the patient underwent L-T4 withdrawal and her Tg unexpectedly rose from 0.8 ng/mL (TSH 5.8 mU/L) to 113.7 ng/mL (TSH 46 mU/L). A concurrent diagnostic I-131 scan (1 mCi) with planar and SPECT/CT imaging revealed focal central neck activity consistent with thyroid remnant and the presence of iodine-avid skeletal metastatic disease involving the left ninth rib, bilateral proximal femurs, and sacrum (Fig. -). Following 320 mCi I-131 therapy based on blood dosimetry calculations, post-therapy scan revealed the additional finding of miliary pulmonary metastases (Fig. ). Due to high-quality SPECT/CT images, separate dedicated CT and bone scan were not necessary. She was subsequently treated with TSH suppression resulting in an undetectable Tg < 0.1 ng/mL (TSH 0.02 mU/L). In order to assess the interval response to I-131 treatment, follow-up evaluation after L-T4 withdrawal protocol was obtained nine months later, demonstrating a stimulated Tg of 0.2 ng/mL (TSH 36.4 mU/L) and negative diagnostic I-131 scan without focal abnormal radioiodine uptake in the neck or skeleton. As she was planning for a second pregnancy and her pulmonary disease was not visible on the prior diagnostic I-131 scan but became apparent only on the post-therapy scan, a 100 mCi I-131 therapeutic challenge was performed to eliminate any microscopic residual disease and more accurately ascertain the treatment response. The post-therapy I-131 scan demonstrated complete resolution of pulmonary metastatic disease; however, faint residual foci of activity were demonstrated in the left ninth rib, sacrum, and left proximal femur, consistent with a partial therapeutic response in the skeleton (Fig. ). Eight months later, Tg was < 0.1 ng/mL (TSH 0.02 mU/L). The patient continues to do well, being conservatively managed with active clinical and biochemical monitoring during L-T4 suppression therapy.","[[30.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['19696610', '21791618', '10958309', '10760768', '24085223', '12727938', '27408758', '25734251', '34522773', '22288964', '34849310', '22550280', '15350384', '33117719', '22181336', '10965973', '25052473', '28101486', '34956924', '9183570', '19471561', '9236892', '25539066', '2773617', '4043953', '25881600', '29946481']"

He was admitted to the acute care unit for observation and oxygen therapy, but his oxygen requirements constantly increased due to moderate ARDS. After 12 days of deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and proning with daily passive range of motion, the patient finally started to initiate active movements and was passively transferred to a chair. However, due to a persisting difficult weaning status, probably related to respiratory muscle weakness, tracheostomy was performed [ventilator settings: pressure support 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 8 cmH2O]. Subsequently, the patient showed significant improvement in his physical functions with active SOEB, chair-transfer with the help of 2 physical therapists, and active in-bed cycling against resistance for 20 minutes (). The strategy was to increase pressure support (by 5 cmH2O) during efforts to reinforce exercise training effects, unloading respiratory muscles. This strategy along with a highly collaborative patient culminated in his rapid improvement in physical function (MRC-SS 58/60, physical function ICU test score 10/12, walking distance 10 m), although he was still experiencing fatigue, inspiratory muscle weakness (maximal inspiratory pressure of −45 cmH2O) and dysphagia upon his transfer to a step-down unit.","[[66.0, 'year']]",M,"['7665777-1', '7665777-2', '7665777-3', '7665777-4', '7665777-5', '7665777-6', '7665777-7', '7665777-8', '7665777-9', '7665777-11']","['32320506', '32293716', '23219649', '30339549', '17470624', '32280973', '34789437', '30427933', '32191813', '31064802', '12493078', '23688302', '24552321', '34602603', '29208005', '32312646', '20046114', '32250385', '23886842', '32345343', '17885261', '29023260', '27940276', '31768568', '34953756', '30113379', '28847238', '33492400']"

At this time, her serum creatinine (Cr) level was within normal range (0.8 mg/dl). One month later, however, the Cr level was elevated to 1.6 mg/dl. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital for admission.
On admission, vital signs revealed body temperature of 36.9 °C, blood pressure of 150/70 mmHg, and pulse rate of 80 per minute. The white blood cell count was 8700/μl with 2.0% eosinophils, red blood cell count was 307 × 104/μl, and platelet count was 26.6 × 104/μl. The following values indicated renal dysfunction; blood urea nitrogen: 25.0 mg/dl, Cr: 1.9 mg/dl, urinary protein: 2.5 g/day, and the presence of microscopic hematuria. Dysmorphic red blood cells were noted in the urine sample microscopically. In the serum, MPO-ANCA was 107 IU/ml (normal limit, 3.5 IU/ml), whereas C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.2 mg/dl. PR3-ANCA and other ANCAs, including anti-elastase and anti-lactoferrin antibodies, were negative. The titer of anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was less than 1:40. Anti-DNA antibody was negative. Complement values were as follows: C3 162.2 mg/dl (normal range, 71–135 mg/dl) and C4 37.7 mg/dl (normal range, 11–34 mg/dl). Renal biopsy revealed pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (Fig. ).
Hydralazine-induced MPO-AAV was considered regardless of absence of skin involvement, elastase- and lactoferrin-ANCAs, anti-nuclear and anti-DNA antibodies, and hypocomplementemia, which are usually observed in the disease []. By discontinuation of the causative drug, the serum Cr level decreased gradually. At 10 months later, the serum Cr and MPO-ANCA levels recovered to 1.1 mg/dl and 13 IU/ml, respectively. Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria also disappeared. Since the clinical course was consistent with hydralazine-induced MPO-AAV and the serum CRP level was not high throughout the clinical course, no additional medication was administered.
After another 6 months of observation, the serum Cr and MPO-ANCA levels were re-elevated (Cr, 2.0 mg/dl; MPO-ANCA, 195 IU/ml) and proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were re-appeared. The titer of ANA was 1:40. Other ANCAs, including PR3-ANCA, and anti-DNA antibody were negative even at this time. Complement values were as follows: C3 149.4 mg/dl and C4 38.5 mg/dl. Renal biopsy was performed again and revealed cellular crescents in some glomeruli (Fig. ). These findings suggested the relapse of MPO-AAV. Since she had fever (38.3 °C), and the serum CRP level was elevated to 10.0 mg/dl at this time, administration of 30 mg prednisone (0.5 mg/kg body weight) was initiated. The illness improved rapidly, and remission was achieved 5 months after the beginning of treatment. The patient has remained in remission thereafter (Table ).
This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Osaka General Medical Center (Permission No. 29-C0313) and the Ethical Committee of Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University (Permission No. 15–90). After acquisition of written informed consent from the patient, serum samples were obtained at the disease onset (Serum A; MPO-ANCA, 107 IU/ml), at relapse (Serum B; MPO-ANCA, 195 IU/ml), at 3 months after treatment (Serum C; MPO-ANCA, 4.5 IU/ml), and at remission (Serum D; MPO-ANCA, 2.4 IU/ml).
To assess the involvement of NETs in the pathophysiology of this patient, we determined the NET degradation activity in the serum samples at first. In brief, peripheral blood neutrophils from a healthy volunteer were seeded in slide chambers (1 × 106/ml), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and then made to react with 100 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 h at 37 °C. We have confirmed that this stimulation induces NETs conspicuously []. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated in 10% Serum A, B, C, or D for 6 h at 37 °C. For positive control, 10% serum of a healthy volunteer (49 years old, male) was employed. This sample exhibited the average value for NET degradation in our previous study []. To stop the serum nuclease activity, 2 mM EDTA was added, and then the remaining cells on the slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by mounting with the solution containing DAPI. Photomicrographs (magnification, × 200) were taken randomly under a fluorescent microscope (6 fields/well of chamber slides), and then the residual NET area was determined using Image J software. NET degradation rate (%) was calculated as follows; {(residual NET area, incubated with PBS) – (residual NET area, incubated with serum) / (residual NET area, incubated with PBS)} × 100. As a result, the NET degradation activity was entirely low in Sera A, B, C, and D compared with the healthy control (Fig. ). Correspondingly, the DNase I activity as determined using ELISA kit (Orgentec GmbH, Mainz, Germany) was low in Sera A (21.7%), B (28.3%), C (22.8%), and D (33.5%) compared with the healthy controls {mean ± standard deviation (SD), 52.6 ± 12.1%}.
Next, we determined the NET induction activity of IgG, which was isolated from the serum samples, using immunoadsorbent columns (Protein G HP SpinTrap, GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan). Contamination of endotoxin in the IgG samples was ruled out using the Limulus test kit (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Peripheral blood neutrophils from a healthy volunteer were seeded in slide chambers (1 × 106/ml), pre-treated with 5 ng/ml TNF-α for 15 min at 37 °C to express MPOs on the cell surface, and then made to react with 250 μg/ml of the IgG samples. Serum IgG samples from a 65-year-old woman patient with MPO-AAV (MPO-ANCA, 93.2 IU/ml) and the healthy volunteer were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. These samples exhibited the average values for NET induction in our previous study []. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were removed and the remaining cells on the slides were fixed with 4% PFA. Finally, the remaining cells were mounted with the DAPI-containing solution. Photomicrographs (magnification, × 200) were taken randomly under a fluorescent microscope (6 fields/well of chamber slides), and then the rates of NET-forming neutrophils were determined using ImageJ software. As a result, the NET induction activity was high in Sera A, B, and C, whereas that in Serum D was equivalent to the healthy control (Fig. ).
Lastly, we conducted immunofluorescent (IF) tests to determine the presence of ANETA in the serum samples. Briefly, peripheral blood neutrophils from a healthy volunteer were seeded in slide chambers (1 × 106/ml), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and then made to react with 20 nM PMA for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA, and then made to react with 250 μg/ml of the IgG samples for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were next allowed to react with 1:5000 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C followed by mounting with the solution containing DAPI. As shown in Fig. , ANCA was detected in Sera A and B but not in Sera C or D; thus, these findings were consistent with the ELISA titers of MPO-ANCA. On the other hand, ANETA was detected in Sera B and C but not in Serum A or D.","[[79.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['1658170', '23549081', '19541821', '15001782', '20439745', '27748260', '2161532', '20733033', '33993184', '22777766', '12370273', '24276086', '27375623', '19448636', '24385592', '32405580', '21170021', '29078325', '23818484', '26531064', '29929470']"

Initial treatment consisted of doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) with melphalan 200 mg/m2 conditioning. He remained in remission for 2.5 years, at which time he relapsed and was treated with a series of doublet regimens followed by a second autologous SCT in 2011, with melphalan 200 mg/m2 conditioning. He relapsed 4 months after the second transplant and was treated with carfilzomib but quickly progressed. The patient eventually achieved a very good partial response with bendamustine and dexamethasone and underwent reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days − 6 to − 2 and melphalan 50 mg/m2 on days − 3 to − 2, followed by a 9/10 matched unrelated allogeneic SCT in November 2012. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of sirolimus and tacrolimus starting day − 3 as well as methotrexate on days + 1, 3, 6, and 11. On day + 27 post-transplant the patient developed acute kidney injury (creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL from a baseline of 0.7) that was attributed to calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. The patient was switched to mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids for GVHD prophylaxis, with normalization of kidney function. By day + 130 the patient was felt to be in at least very good partial remission based on negative serum protein immunofixation and 99.8% peripheral blood donor chimerism.
On day + 132, the patient returned to the hospital with diarrhea with scant blood. He underwent colonoscopy with biopsy. Histologic analysis demonstrated findings consistent with CMV colitis and GVHD: crypt apoptotic bodies, ulcerations, and CMV inclusions were noted. He was started on ganciclovir, and prednisone was increased from 60 mg daily to 60 mg twice daily. He was discharged 2 weeks later, at which time the platelet count had decreased from 93,000/μL on admission (normal 150,000–450,000/μL) to 29,000/μL. The thrombocytopenia was attributed to a combination of antiviral medication and CMV infection.
He returned to the hospital 1 week later (day + 146) with recurrence of profuse diarrhea with small amounts of blood and associated abdominal cramping. Diarrhea was attributed to worsening GVHD. He was restarted on tacrolimus but continued to have maroon-colored stool output. A colonoscopy was repeated and was notable grossly for pancolitis with scattered ulcerations, ileocecal valve ulceration, mild ileitis, anorectal junction ulcers, and internal hemorrhoids that were not bleeding. The pathology report again suggested CMV infection and GVHD (increased crypt apoptotic bodies, focal erosions, and a positive CMV immunostain). During that admission, a diagnosis of TMA was considered due to a persistently low hemoglobin of approximately 9 g/dL (normal 13–17 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia that persisted in 30,000–50,000/μL range. A peripheral smear at that time showed 2–4 schistocytes/HPF in the setting of a haptoglobin of 22 mg/dL (normal 36–195 mg/dL) and a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 731 U/L (normal < 260 U/L). Overall, the patient met 6 out of 7 of the TA-TMA criteria proposed by Cho et al. His tacrolimus was again discontinued, and he was maintained on a combination of sirolimus (goal level 5–7), mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids for GVHD treatment. At the time of discharge, his hemoglobin was 8.7 g/dL and platelets were 20,000/μL.
On day + 156 the patient returned to the hospital with multiple episodes of bright red blood per rectum. He had diffuse patchy ecchymoses on physical exam. The platelet count was 17,000/μL. A colonoscopy was repeated, and per visual inspection the GVHD was felt to be improved. Hemorrhoidal bleeding was suspected as the cause of the bleeding, and colorectal surgery was consulted. He underwent sclerotherapy for hemorrhoids prior to discharge.
On day + 188 TMA was again considered in the setting of an LDH of 1147 U/L. Sirolimus was discontinued. A peripheral blood smear, however, showed no schistocytes, and haptoglobin returned within low-normal range at 43 mg/dL. TMA was therefore felt to be unlikely. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, performed for another indication, revealed an unexpected finding of pneumatosis intestinalis involving the ascending and transverse colon. This finding was attributed to GVHD and CMV and, as the patient was felt to be relatively asymptomatic, no specific intervention was performed. Sirolimus was restarted given the concerning imaging findings and lack of strong evidence for TMA.
The patient was re-admitted on day + 211, this time with melenic stool. A tagged red blood cell scan identified the ascending colon as a source of bleeding. An angiogram with attempted embolization was unsuccessful due to inability to identify a bleeding vessel. Hemolysis labs were repeated given persistent cytopenias, including a hemoglobin of 7.1 g/dL and a platelet count of 37,000/μL. Haptoglobin was undetectable, and LDH was elevated at 1254 U/L. A repeat peripheral smear demonstrated a normocytic, normochromic anemia without increase in schistocytes. Sirolimus was again discontinued. The patient remained anemic and intermittently refractory to red blood cell transfusions, prompting two additional attempts at angiogram/embolization, neither of which successfully identified a bleeding vessel. A bone marrow biopsy was repeated and revealed a hypocellular marrow without evidence of myeloma relapse.
On day + 217 the patient was transferred to the medical ICU for high volume bloody stool output, a hemoglobin of 6.3, and lightheadedness. The INR was 1.0 with a PTT of 22. A wireless capsule endoscopy and a repeat tagged red blood cell scan were both unsuccessful at identifying a source of bleed. A colonoscopy with biopsy was repeated; 2 visible vessels were identified and clipped. Histologic analysis did not show evidence of persistent GVHD or CMV colitis. An EGD with biopsy revealed no abnormalities on histologic analysis. He was managed supportively with transfusions as needed but then began to develop confusion, agitation, and increasing anger. Psychiatry was consulted for delirium. LDH was 767 U/L, and the haptoglobin was low at < 35 mg/dL. Platelets were 47,000/μL, and the INR was 1.1. A peripheral smear was repeated and did not show schistocytes. An ADAMTS13 level was ordered given recurrent suspicion for TMA, and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated empirically pending that result. The patient’s confusion was noted to improve following TPE, and he completed a total of 5 exchanges. LDH improved to 372 U/L. ADAMTS13 level ultimately returned at 60% (normal > 66%). Shortly thereafter, the patient developed copious hematochezia associated with a drop in hemoglobin from 8.9 to 6.9 g/dL. He was taken urgently to the operating room for visceral angiogram, which did not identify a bleeding vessel. An ileocolectomy was performed, but the patient suffered a cardiac arrest intra-operatively and expired shortly thereafter.
A post-mortem analysis of the resection specimen revealed TMA involving numerous arteries and arterioles in the ileal and colonic submucosa as well as few thrombosed arterioles in the muscularis propria and deep lamina propria of the mucosa (Figs. and ). Rare thrombosed arterioles were identified in the appendix. The TMA in many of the vessels was active, characterized by endothelial cell swelling, endothelial cell detachment with intimal expansion by pale plasma protein material (“mucoid intimal edema”), and accumulation of fibrin and red cell fragments within expanded intimal zones and vascular lumina. A smaller number of arteries and arterioles showed features of persistent or chronic microangiopathic changes, such as concentric layers of new basement membrane material alternating with intimal edema well as focal presence of foam cells within artery intimal zones. All venous structures were patent without thrombosis. In areas of more severe TMA, there were foci of perivascular hemorrhage and deep ulceration extending into the superficial muscularis propria. Non-ulcerated mucosa showed architectural distortion and crypt regenerative features, consistent with previous injury. Additionally, there were areas of crypt dropout with replacement of mucosa by healing granulation tissue and an overlying layer of regenerative epithelium. Scattered CMV inclusions were visible within endothelial cells of the granulation tissue. However, there was no evidence of CMV infection by light microscopy or immunohistochemistry within endothelium of vessels affected by TMA. There was no significant increase in crypt apoptosis, arguing against GVHD.
A retrospective review of the patient’s previous colonic biopsies was performed. In addition to the initially reported findings, biopsies from days 146 and 217 showed subtle features of TMA (Fig. ); these included rare thrombosed arterioles in the deep lamina propria and superficial submucosa surrounded by perivascular hemorrhage as well as few arterioles with subendothelial expansion by pale material accompanied by underlying layers of new basement membrane material.","[[54.0, 'year']]",M,['8173405-1'],"['31175815', '28795840', '17277791', '27621680', '19139727', '20697372', '12627855', '31024873', '27064689', '34141795', '24370861', '26150023', '22804695', '25654478', '16041306', '26603840', '20717073', '29339271', '27156964', '17229640', '12201469', '28522344', '24876561', '25483393', '32981026', '29977661']"

The rash had started on her upper extremities and then spread to her face, chest, and thighs 2 days prior to admission. At times, the rash had been itchy and the patient had reported chills. She had been started on clozapine 10 days prior to admission. On admission she was febrile to 38.1°C, tachycardic to 113 bpm, and hypotensive to 96/63. On exam, she had a maculopapular rash that was nonblanching over her entire body except her lower legs. There was no mucosal involvement, but she had mild facial edema. Pertinent admission labs included WBC 6.9 (3.7–11.4 103/µL), Hgb 10.6 (10.8–15.3 g/dL), platelet 196 (140–393 K/µL), eosinophils 10 (0–6%), eosinophils absolute 0.7 (0.0–0.5 103/µL), aspartate aminotransferase 81 (14–36 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 125 (9–52 U/L), alkaline phosphatase 155 (38–126 U/L), and hepatitis C antibody positive. Her urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase with white blood cells, squamous cells, and few bacteria. Imaging on admission included chest X-ray, which showed a small left sided pleural effusion. A CT chest was done which showed minimal bilateral atelectasis with trace pleural effusions and cholelithiasis with contracted gallbladder and pericholecystic fluid.
At this point, there was concern for infectious etiology, and blood cultures were drawn. The patient was then started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with cefepime and vancomycin. Clozapine was stopped and her benztropine and lithium were initially continued as she had been on these for many years. After being seen by psychiatry, they were also discontinued. She was given Benadryl for her rash. Hepatitis C viral PCR pathogens were found to be negative. Blood cultures grew staphylococcus coagulase negative and urine culture showed mixed flora with no infection. The blood cultures were thought to be a contaminant, so they were redrawn and the second set did not grow anything. Antibiotics were discontinued, as there was no further concern for infectious etiology. Eosinophils continued to be elevated and she developed a leukocytosis. The next three days, her white blood cell count continued to rise and peaked at 26.5 103/µL. She had worsening fever and became more tachycardic. Liver enzymes continued to rise, so an ultrasound abdomen was performed due to concern for cholecystitis, which was negative. Antibiotics were restarted due to concern for infection. Her eosinophil count rose and peaked at 14%. She had an echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis, which was within normal limits. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast was done to rule out an abdominal infection. It showed colon thickening, cholelithiasis, trace pleural effusions, and porta hepatis lymphadenopathy. Antibiotics were all discontinued again as infectious etiologies had been ruled out. At this point, there was concern for drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) as she had the classic signs of DRESS including eosinophilia, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, and elevated liver enzymes. Other viral exanthema reactivations that are associated with DRESS were also considered. EBV, HHV-6, and HHV-7 were drawn, and all came back negative. Mononucleosis testing was not done on presentation although this can present as DRESS syndrome.
Dermatology was also consulted and agreed that this was DRESS syndrome. Methylprednisone IV 125 mg three times daily was started along with clobetasol twice a day. After starting prednisone, fever and white blood cell count improved. Eosinophils trended back down to normal limits and liver enzymes started trending down. She was discharged on an oral prednisone taper for 12 days. Outpatient follow-up did not show any further eosinophilia, white blood cell elevation, or elevated liver enzymes. Rash improved and disintegrated.","[[32.0, 'year']]",F,"['7188262-1', '7188262-2', '7188262-3', '7188262-4', '3766753-1']","['28784369', '24023555', '23602183', '23602182', '32332465', '9669191', '21592453', '28784381', '34426483', '29991947']"

She had a history of restrictive AN, binge-purge behaviour, and an old traumatic brain injury, leaving her with memory problems. She was well known to mental health services, having been admitted multiple times to eating disorder centres for nasogastric feeding. She had never smoked in her life and denied any alcohol intake. The patient was on ferrous fumarate, fexofenadine, fluoxetine, ibuprofen, lansoprazole, quetiapine, supplemental vitamins, regular morphine (modified release), and gabapentin.
On admission, her blood pressure was 106/85 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, heart rate was 64 beats/minute, temperature was 35.1 °C, and capillary blood glucose was 6 mmol/L. Her weight on admission was 37.3 kg (body mass index [BMI] = 12.6). On examination, she was clearly malnourished, cachexic, and dehydrated. The rest of the clinical examination was normal, as shown in Table . Her chest radiograph showed patchy consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes (Figure ). She was prescribed appropriate antibiotics. She was refusing treatment and was deemed to lack the capacity to make that decision. Therefore, Section 5(2) under the Mental Health Act was put in place. She was commenced on oral supplements as per guidance from the dietitian, and then switched to nasogastric feeding.
On the night of the second day, she had an episode of decreased consciousness, bradypnoea (RR-6), and hypotension (83/64). Her blood sugar level was 6.6 mmol/L. After receiving Naloxone, her symptoms improved, and her opiates were discontinued. The following day she mentioned right upper quadrant pain. Blood tests showed worsening liver enzymes, as shown in Table . An abdominal ultrasound was performed on the fourth day of admission, which showed multiple small calculi and biliary debris, with gallbladder oedema, and a small amount of peri-cholecystic fluid (Figure ).
She was treated for cholecystitis with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and clarithromycin, which led to improvement in her inflammatory markers in the following days. She underwent an inpatient magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to rule out intra-biliary pathology, which was negative. Subsequently, she was referred to surgeons for consideration of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy once deemed fit.
She had a protracted and difficult admission. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, her transfer to an Eating Disorders Unit proved difficult. By the fourth week of admission, her liver enzymes had improved, as can be seen in Table . Nasogastric feeding was successfully weaned as her weight improved.

One week prior he was admitted to the local hospital due to low-grade fever, difficulty swallowing and hoarseness. He received intravenous ceftriaxone and clindamycin for presumptive diagnosis of deep neck infection. He had history of hypertension treated with amlodipine 10 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily. He had habits of heavy alcohol drinking for 40 years, and smoking. He works at the department of fisheries. He swam, cleaned fish pond and mowed the lawn. Upon admission (day 0), the patient's body weight was 52 kg, body mass index was 19.7 kg/m2. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 38.7 °C; blood pressure, 170/100 mmHg, pulse rate, 100 beats/min; respiratory rate, 24 breaths/min. On physical examination, mild pale conjuctivae, anicteric sclerae. The neck exam revealed pulsatile left neck mass size 5 × 5 cm in diameters, mild tender on palpation, no sign of inflammation. No limitation of neck movement. Oropharyngeal exam revealed bulging of left posterior pharyngeal wall and tonsil enlargement causing the narrowing of upper airway. Thyroid gland was not enlarged. Other exams included neurological exam were normal. Skin exam revealed multiple ill-defined scaly mild erythematous patches on both legs and dystrophic nails. Initial laboratory results showed anemia with hemoglobin concentration of 9.6 g/L and Hematocrit of 28%, MCV of 75 fl, white blood cell count of 6800 cells/mm3 with 80% neutrophil 7.7% lymphocytes, platelet count of 574,000 cells/mm3. Hemoglobin typing was normal (HbF 0.2% HbA2 2.9% HbA 85.9%; HbA2A). Liver function test showed AST 87 U/L, ALT 97 U/L, ALP 127 U/L, GGT 936 U/L, TB 0.3 mg/dl, DB 0.1 mg/dl, TP 81.2 g/L, Alb 28.7 g/L.

He was diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and xerotic eczema. Computer tomography of the neck showed a concealed ruptured of left external carotid artery 0.9 × 1.9 cm in size with surrounding hematoma (3.6 × 3.6 ×5.8 cm) at medial aspect of an aneurysm resulted in narrowing of the upper airway (A, B). Urgent surgical exploration on day 0 revealed severe adhesion around pseudoaneurysm (size 5 × 6 cm) confined around common carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, extended to the angle of mandible. The diameter of pseudoaneurysm neck was one cm, located at medial wall of common carotid artery just distal to carotid bifurcation. External carotid artery was obliterated. Angiogram and balloon occlusion was performed at the left common carotid artery. External carotid artery and internal carotid artery were ligated at the arterial stump just beneath the angle of mandible. Pseudoaneurysm was resected and internal content show pus and clot. Surgical margins were not free in gross section. The pus was sent for bacterial culture. Blood agar plate revealed rare growth of whitish colony, direct exam from the colony revealed broad rare septate fungal hyphae. Infectious disease was consulted on day 5 of admission. Serum antibodies to pythium antigen using an in-house rapid immunochromatographic test were positive on day 5. Sabouraud's glucose agar (SGA) grew fungal colony which identified as P. insidiosum by the induction of motile zoospore and confirmed by fungal broad-range 18S rDNA gene polymerase chain reaction. Pathology of carotid artery revealed acute suppurative inflammation () with branching broad rare septate hyphae demonstrated by Gomori Methanamine Silver stain and Periodic acid-Shiff stain (A) Immunohistochemistry stain for P. insidiosum was positive (B). Medical therapy with oral itraconazole 200 mg oral twice daily combined with terbinafine 250 mg oral twice daily were started on day 5. Adjunctive immunotherapy with subcutaneous injection of PIA vaccine 500 microliter (4 mg/ml) was given on day 6 and 18 of admission. Day 5, Computer tomography of the aorta shows atherosclerotic change without aneurysm or dissection. Postoperatively, physical exams revealed narrowing of upper airway, hypoglossal nerve palsy on the left side without motor deficit. Neurology was consulted on day 6. He was diagnosed with hypoglossal nerve palsy secondary to compression of carotid artery aneurysm. On Day 6, MRI and MRA of the brain revealed pseudoaneurysm of carotid artery at left carotid-parapharyngeal spaces (2.8 × 2.0 × 3.1 cm) associated with extensive inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue resulting in mild narrowing of upper airway. Left common carotid artery was occluded along the origin to the cavernous part of left internal carotid artery with the evidence of wall enhancement. Multifocal cerebritis consistent with cerebral septic emboli and leptomeningeal enhancement at the left cerebral hemisphere (). The patient underwent second exploration of the left neck on day 9 aiming to remove the residual infected necrotic tissue. Operative findings revealed pus with necrotic soft tissue extended to parapharyngeal space, however artery cannot be defined. The radical neck dissection could not be performed due to the morbidity outweigh the possibility of the cure. Tissue specimen revealed identical findings with the first operation. On day 6, the dosage of terbinafine was increased to 250 mg three times daily, itraconazole was continued. The patient and family decided for palliative care, no aggressive treatment. He was discharged on day 19 of hospitalization. On day 29 after discharge, upon an outpatient visit, his family mentioned that he developed progressive right hemiparesis over the two days after discharge. Physical exams revealed healed surgical wound of the left neck, narrowing of upper airway, neurological exams revealed global aphasia, right facial palsy (upper motor neuron), motor power grade I on the right side. His family denied further investigation. He continued to take combination of oral terbinafine, itraconazole and PIA vaccine. On day 49, upon an outpatient visit, he had flaccid hemiparesis on the right side without other deficit. He received fourth dose of PIA vaccine and continued oral itraconazole and terbinafine.

She had severe class III malocclusion and facial deformity, which included nasal and mandibular deviation to the right. After taking a comprehensive medical and dental history, we noticed that the patient had hypodontia with several impacted teeth due to amelogenesis imperfecta (Figure ).
Intra-oral clinical examination revealed horizontal discrepancy of alveolar ridge, knife-edge mandibular alveolar ridge, uneven alveolar ridge, and a deep palate (Figure ).
Routine radiographic examinations consisting of panoramic radiography and lateral cephalometry were requested. The cephalogram exhibited anterior-posterior discrepancy of the jaw in the horizontal plane and a pseudo-long face.
Following consultation with a prosthodontist, cosmetic surgery was scheduled for the patient to correct her long face, mid-face deficiency, jaw deviation to the right, class III discrepancy, and alveolar ridge deficiency followed by dental implant placement and full mouth prosthetic rehabilitation. After consultation with an orthodontist, it was found that forced eruption of the impacted teeth was not possible; thus, the teeth were extracted under local anesthesia.
Primary impressions were made using irreversible hydrocolloid impression material (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Special trays were fabricated, and final impression was made by zinc oxide eugenol (Wuhan Xingzhengshun, Hubei, China). Then, the occlusal rims were made to record the inter-arch relationship, and the casts were mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator (Dentatus, New York, USA) in centric relation. The teeth were arranged in class III occlusion, and then they were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) to make them opaque for easy detection of the occlusal line for Epker cephalometric prediction tracing (Figure ).
The Epker prediction tracing was performed for preoperative assessments, which included analysis of the maxillary retrognathism, mandibular prognathism, and excess skeletal vertical growth. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy and LeFort I osteotomy were scheduled. According to the data obtained from the lateral cephalogram of the patient and clinical examinations (zygomatic regions, paranasal area, nasolabial, and gonial angles, SNA, SNB, and ANB angles), the surgeon planned a mandibular setback procedure by 7 mm and repositioning of the maxilla by 2 mm superiorly and 5 mm anteriorly on surgical casts. Then, the casts were mounted in this new position and the jaw relations were determined. Posterior teeth were arranged in new articulation and the final dentures were fabricated. The surgeon used these dentures for the edentulous patient as the final surgical splint. Mandibular cast and denture setback by 7 mm relative to its current position and an intermediate stent was fabricated using auto-polymerizing acrylic resin (Kulzer, Newbury, UK). Then, dentures were fabricated as splint and after polishing, several holes were drilled in the base of denture, and the arch bar was bonded to it. Circummandibular wires for the mandible and palatal screws were used to fix the splints to the corresponding jaws. The surgical procedure of the maxilla and mandible was performed using these splints (Figure ).
Alveolar ridge augmentation was performed by harvesting a graft from the iliac crest. The graft was placed upon a surgical stent and fixed to the external maxillary surfaces with a screw and plate.
After 2 weeks, temporary complete dentures were delivered to the patient. They were adjusted using tissue conditioner (Kerr, USA). Six months later, an impression was made and a radiographic stent was fabricated for implant placement. To determine the proper location for placement of implants, gutta-percha points (VDW, Munich, Germany) were placed at the center of desired teeth in ideal direction of implant, and the outer surfaces of the teeth were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) (Figure ).
The patient underwent cone beam computed tomography with stent to determine the proper site of implant placement (Figure ). Proper diagonal length and angle of 16 implants (Dentium, Implantium, Korea, Seoul), eight in each jaw, were determined by stent according to the available bone volume. Implants were inserted using a surgical stent. The temporary complete dentures of patient were relined and delivered to the patient. Three months later, the implants were uncovered, and healing abutments were tightened. Primary impression of the healing was made by alginate (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Primary cast was poured. After fabrication of special tray, final impression was made using the open tray technique following splinting of impression copings using polyvinyl siloxane (Zhengzhou Huaer, Henan, China). The final cast was fabricated. Impression verification jig was fabricated in a dental laboratory and was tried in patient's mouth to confirm the accuracy of impression. Next, the record base and wax rims were fabricated. The jaw relations were recorded by rims, and after that the teeth were arranged. The teeth set-up was checked in the mouth. A putty index was made from the arranged teeth and accordingly, proper abutment angle and gingival height were determined.
The three-part frames (Degubond, Dentsply sirona prosthetics, U.S.A, Pennsylvania) for the maxilla and mandible were fabricated. Frames were tried in the mouth, and the fit of frames was checked radiographically (Figure ). Porcelain crowns with A2 shade were fabricated. Implant-supported crowns were cemented with a temporary cement (Kerr, Toronto, Canada) (Figure ). The patient was fully satisfied with the results at the six-year follow-up.","[[22.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['27790575', '23119126', '26576273', '28042439', '34220167', '19651361', '23119136', '29988680']"

Patient has lost the foreseen weight at 6 months (50 kg, BMI = 30.86 kg/m2, %EWL = 72.5%), but he presented to our institution 8 months later with a left pleuritic chest pain, nonradiating in nature associated with left shoulder pain, dyspnea, fever, chills, and decrease food intake (he stopped eating well 2 weeks prior to presentation because of described odynophagia and took multiple doses of IV NSAIDS). Upon admission, patient was hypotensive with a deteriorating general status (anxious, nadir GCS was 11, hypotensive, tachycardic) and a bad respiratory status (dyspnea, tachypnea, crackles on physical exam specially in the left side, with decrease left sided air entry). A chest x-ray showed a left massive pleural effusion with left lower lobe consolidation (effusion + pneumonia) (Fig. ). In an effort to explain the cause of the effusion, a CT scan chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast, showed a proximal stomach (gastro-esophageal junction) staple line fistula that was draining to what was first described as a left upper quadrant abscess later found to be a GC fistula causing a left pleural effusion (reactional effusion) (Figs. and ). He had a chest tube placed immediately that drained nonpurulent sero-sanguinous liquid of which one set of culture was taken. He was then started on empiric antibiotics, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin, after cultures were taken and the patient was kept NPO. Four days later, chest tube was removed, and conservative management was continued. Total parenteral nutrition was started because the patient was malnourished, with low serum albumin, low iron, and evident muscular wasting (although he maintained a BMI of 26). Results of new cultures were out and showed no growth. Patient's antibiotics were switched to piperacillin/tazobactam and fluconazole. He was scheduled for a salvage surgery with a laparoscopic esophagogastrectomy with a Roux-en-Y esophagojejunal reconstruction when his nutritional status was adequate enough for the procedure, and after resolution of his infection. Ten days after, a repeat CT scan was done that showed a smaller residual left pleural effusion plus enhancement of the visceral and peritoneal pleura, and persistence of the gastro-colic fistula (Fig. ). GP fistula was excluded and GC fistula was confirmed. Patient was discharged home with a naso-jejunal tube (placed 1 day before discharge) for enteral feeding with high protein shakes (1500 mL Fresubin HP and 10 scoops of Protiphar/day to compensate for his daily caloric needs of 2400 kcal per day) and was kept on PO antibiotics (co-amoxiclav). A total of 14 days of IV antibiotics and another 2 weeks of PO antibiotics were taken. Upon many outpatients’ consultations, the patient family was concerned with the possible risks and benefits of the reoperation that was thoroughly explained to them and to the patient with multiple counseling sessions. They opted to continue conservative treatment (antibiotics + naso-jejunal enteral nutrition) in an attempt for the fistula to resolve without surgery because they feared the possible outcomes. The patient was carefully monitored over the course of 8 weeks with serial CT scans and outpatient visits, and finally on the last CT scan, the GC fistula had completely resolved (Fig. ), with no evidence of pleural effusion and the patient was started on a progressive oral diet after removal of the Naso-Jejunal tube. On future follow-ups, the patient seemed to do well, with adequate nutrition and good quality of life.","[[28.0, 'year']]",M,['8121443-1'],"['22361308', '22752283', '17981515', '26224371', '31297741', '34017589', '19506979', '29988675']"

On admission, he presented systemic lymphadenopathy without any bone marrow involvement. Laboratory tests showed normal liver enzymes levels as well as negative hepatitis B and C serological profiles.
An oxaliplatin-based polychemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation was proposed. First-line chemotherapy with four cycles of R-DHAX regimen, including rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine and oxaliplatin was administered. After three courses, PET-CT (positron emission tomography) response assessment indicated a complete metabolic response. The patient then received conditioning regimen with BEAM 400, consisting of bicnu (300 mg/m2) for 1 day, etoposide (400 mg/m2) combined to cytarabine (400 mg/m2) for 4 days and melphalan (140 mg/m2) for 1 day prior to autologous HSCT. Anti-infective prophylaxis included valacyclovir and fluconazole, starting on Day −7. On March 16th, 2015 (Day 0), 9.8 × 106 cells CD34+/kg were infused. During this procedure, laboratory data did not display any abnormality, especially hepatic enzymes levels that were within the normal range. Despite antimicrobial therapy with Piperacillin–Tazobactam, the patient had persistent fever over the ensuing 72 h, requiring an empiric antifungal treatment with Voriconazole. No signs of invasive aspergillosis were detected (normal CT-scan) and aspergillus antigenemia were negative. Voriconazole was then replaced by Caspofungin on Day +6. On Day +8, oligoanuria was observed and physical examination revealed hepatomegaly, fluid retention, ascites and weight gain < 5% (i.e. 90 kg, +2 kg/48 h). Additionally, thrombocytopenia refractory to platelet transfusion was noted. On Day +9, the serum transaminase concentration increased in an explosive manner from 75 to 2914 UI/L in the morning and 5046 UI/L in the evening for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and from 45 to 1216 UI/L for alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Similarly, the bilirubin level had reached 67 µmol/L (N < 21) accompanied with elevated creatinine level shifting from normal value to 230 µmol/L within 24 h (Fig. ). Alkaline phosphatase levels were initially normal and progressively increased along with SOS/VOD syndrome (2× ULN). The patient developed coagulation disorders as revealed by a progressive increase of INR whereas the Factor V remained normal (Fig. ). An elevated level of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) was also noted with a value of 51 UA/mL (N < 16). An abdominal ultrasound was performed and confirmed hepatomegaly, ascites and decreased velocity in the portal venous flow. The subject whose weight increased more than 5% (i.e. 92 kg) was therefore diagnosed with hepatic VOD and was admitted to the Intensive Care unit. A treatment with Defibrotide at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day was immediately initiated.
Because of the atypical major increase in transaminases levels, a transvenous liver biopsy was performed on Day +10 and showed a patchy perivenular sinusoidal dilatation and congestion with hepatocyte plate disruption (Fig. ). A second abdominal ultrasound further supported the diagnosis of SOS/VOD with a worsening of doppler parameters, then harboring a reversed hepatic venous flow. Moreover, differential diagnoses such as fulminant viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C and E, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus) were excluded. Despite symptomatic measures along with the maintenance of an adequate fluid balance and ascites removal with albumin infusion, renal failure could not be controlled. Because of anuria, hemodialysis was thus implemented on Day +9.
Neutrophils recovery was achieved on Day +11 and liver dysfunction gradually improved from Day +13 to Day +15 with decreased transaminases levels ([AST] 408 UI/L; [ALT] 494 UI/L) (Fig. ). Although his overall condition was progressively recovering, the patient presented a sudden hemodynamic instability with an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanic ventilation, on Day +16. A fulminant liver failure with uncontrolled lactic acidosis was observed. An abdominal CT scan was performed and showed an acute mesenteric ischemia with hepatic and renal ischemic injury. The patient died a few hours later of a multi-organ-system failure.","[[59.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['21339345', '9156266', '24833355', '28444784', '21460864', '20709662', '25401997', '9808553', '27183098', '9058743', '24102514', '26825712', '19766729', '14998849', '27377614', '29970140']"

ADPKD had been diagnosed by ultrasound in 1998, which was performed because of hypertension and a positive family history for ADPKD. DNA analysis later showed a PKD2 mutation. In 2008, serum creatinine level was 94 μmol/L, with an eGFR of 83 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by the CKD-EPI formula []. Total kidney volume (TKV) was 2351 mL, and height adjusted TKV 1292 mL/m, corresponding to MAYO risk class 1D []. Urine showed microalbuminuria (albumin: creatinine ratio 4.75 g/mmol). Pre-tolvaptan, his 24-h urine volume was 1300 mL.
In that same year, tolvaptan was initiated and uptitrated to the maximum dose of 120 mg per day (90/30 mg) within three weeks. After completion of the TEMPO 3:4 trial, tolvaptan was stopped for one month. Thereafter tolvaptan was re-started as part of a compassionate use program. In 2015 this patient developed hypertension despite use of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan 100 mg q.d.) and a beta-blocker (metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.). Previously an alpha-blocker and a calcium antagonist had led to intolerable side-effects. Therefore HCT was started at a dose of 12.5 mg q.d. that was well-tolerated, and was later increased to 25 mg q.d.
Urinary volumes before and during tolvaptan treatment are shown in Fig. . In 2011, this patient collected 24-h urine once during the month in which tolvaptan was temporarily stopped. At that time urine volume was 1280 mL and urine osmolality 632 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume (based on five measurements) on tolvaptan before HCT initiation was 4867 mL, mean urine osmolality was 212 mOsm/kg (range 164–250 mOsm/kg). After initiation of HCT (12.5 mg q.d.) 24-h urine production declined to 2878 mL, while urine osmolality increased to 290 mOsm/kg. After the increase of HCT to 25 mg q.d. the last 24-h urine collection measured 2699 mL and 280 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume had declined during HCT co-treatment by 2078 mL (43%).
24-h creatinine excretion was used to verify whether urine collections were complete, assuming unchanged muscle mass over time creatinine excretion should be similar between urine collections. Mean 24-h creatinine excretion before start of HCT was 18.1 mmol/24 h, and after start of HCT 16.7 mmol/24 h, indicating no difference in urine collected.
During the nine-year treatment period, serum electrolytes were measured 37 times and stayed within the normal range during the whole period. These electrolytes include potassium (range 3.9–4.6 mmol/L), sodium (range 136–144 mmol/L) and calcium (range 2.34–2.57 mmol/L). There were no differences in average electrolyte concentration between the period with tolvaptan monotherapy and the period with tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.
eGFR declined from 83 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2008 to 57 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2017 (Fig. ). While on tolvaptan monotherapy the slope of eGFR decline was − 1.35 mL/min/1.73m2 per year, whereas this was − 3.97 mL/minute/1.73m2 per year while on tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.
Copeptin, a surrogate marker of vasopressin [], was measured a total of five times, all in a fasting state around the same time in the morning. In the three years on tolvaptan monotherapy it was measured twice, with values of 24.4 and 20.5 pmol/L. In the month the patient temporarily stopped using tolvaptan, copeptin dropped to 11.1 pmol/L. Thereafter, tolvaptan was reinitiated and copeptin increased to 23.3 pmol/L. Copeptin was highest during tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy: 29.7 pmol/L.","[[46.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['17434405', '27325254', '11359016', '18832246', '17703139', '19414839', '26077742', '34713320', '29105594', '30228150', '13812709', '24993447', '8432162', '25600953', '4944156', '32734239', '33005739', '24827775', '33150452', '5852668', '18550938', '34480075', '31692482', '23121377', '24904092', '28379536', '13644230', '16695887', '29970015']"

Diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion in the upper outer quadrant of right breast measuring 14 mm x 13 mm x 18 mm and 5 x 4 mm satellite lesion is noted 6 mm inferior to the dominant mass, BI-RADS 5 highly suggestive of malignancy. Due to concern for multifocal disease, MRI breast with without contrast was done and it showed 2.3 x 1.1 x 2.7 cm irregular-shaped, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins in the upper outer quadrant of right breast, 7 cm from the nipple, 1.2 cm from the skin and there was an additional mass measuring 8 mm x 4 mm x 1.6 cm at 12:00 along with 4 mm lesion, 7 mm from the nipple at 10:00 (Figures (a) and (b)). Right breast biopsy from the dominant lesion showed invasive mammary carcinoma with features of both lobular and ductal carcinoma, Nottingham histological grade 2, estrogen receptor 90%, progesterone receptor 100%, HER2 2+ by IHC but negative by FISH, Ki-67 50%.
Status post right breast simple mastectomy and axillary lymph node evaluation. Surgical pathology showed a multifocal invasive mammary carcinoma of the breast with ductal and lobular features, size of largest invasive carcinoma was 55 mm, size of additional invasive foci was 1.5 mm, Nottingham histological grade 2 of 3, low to intermediate nuclear grade DCIS without central necrosis measuring at least 6 mm, margins uninvolved, one benign sentinel lymph node. Pathological staging (m)pT3 (sn)N0. Oncotype DX breast recurrence score of 16 (for patients <50 years of age, benefit from chemotherapy 1.6%). Genetic testing did not reveal any clinically significant mutations. The patient has received adjuvant PMRT 5000 cGy dose, 25 fractions along with 1000 cGy scar boost. Based on TEXT/SOFT data ovarian suppression could be considered in patients with high-risk features. The patient's tumor was multifocal, and the largest lesion measured 5.5 cm. The patient elected against surgical menopause. The patient was started on ovarian suppression with goserelin 3.6 mg every 28 days along with letrozole 2.5 mg once daily.
Sixteen months after initiation of ovarian suppression patient started having a regular menstrual cycle while on goserelin. No medication interaction or missed doses were noted. The patient's BMI was 41.1 and BSA was 2.19 m2. Estradiol was 92 pg/mL and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.3 mIU/mL in the premenopausal range. Few prior case reports showing failure of goserelin ovarian ablation in a premenopausal woman were reported. Given high-risk disease, discussed benefit of continued ovarian suppression plus AIs versus tamoxifen alone, and discussed the role of oophorectomy which results are reliable and prompt reduction in circulating estrogens. The patient was hesitant and wished to wait before the oophorectomy. She was started on triptorelin 3.75 mg IM once every 28 days.","[[36.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['29510273', '10953134', '30258937', '30651078', '7860418', '21555684', '32616435', '12488405', '10620455', '21541703', '26729430', '17138645', '29863451', '3139467', '25495490', '23958111', '26729437', '34956746']"

Physical examination showed abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness with the presence of prominent superficial abdominal veins. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with contrast was obtained immediately. The CT showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC extending from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Initially, a plan was made to start the patient on anticoagulation, but because of the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis, large esophageal varices on recent endoscopy, and thrombocytopenia, we concluded that the patient was not a candidate for anticoagulation. Given that the patient had significant abdominal distention with pain that did not improve even after therapeutic paracentesis; we inserted a stent in the IVC to relieve the patient’s pain as a palliative procedure to improve his quality of life.
Right internal jugular (IJ) and right femoral vein accesses were obtained for the procedure. A 6F pigtail diagnostic catheter was advanced from the right IJ to the right atrium, and contrast was injected into the right atrium that showed an occluded IVC at the junction of the right atrium. Another pigtail catheter was advanced through the right femoral vein and an inferior venogram was performed that showed the IVC was 100% occluded 2 cm above the renal veins (Figures , ).
A Glidewire advantage was advanced through the right femoral vein but was unable to cross the 100% occluded IVC. Then, a 7-French Swan-Ganz catheter was tried and was successfully advanced through the IVC all the way to the right atrium. A Swan wire was inserted through the Swan-Ganz catheter. Then, a multipurpose catheter was advanced over the Swan wire into the right atrium, and the Swan-Ganz wire was successfully replaced with a Glidewire Advantage (Figure ). Initially, a 9 × 80 Mustang balloon was used to perform the IVC ballooning; after IVC ballooning; however, the inferior venogram showed no flow to the IVC, which was still 100% occluded. Then, a 22 × 70 mm Wallstent was advanced via the right femoral vein to the right atrial side. The stent was deployed with a considerable waist in the mid area (Figure ). After stent placement, an 18 × 60 Boston Scientific esophageal balloon was successfully used to post-dilate the stent (Figure ).
The final venogram (Figures , ) and digital subtraction imaging mode showed excellent flow in the IVC to the right atrium. Small clots floating around at the lower edge of the stent above the renal artery were successfully removed with a 7-Fr snare. Usually, if IVC occlusion is of thrombosis in etiology anticoagulation is advised after venous stent placement, since our patient had an advanced liver failure with elevated INR, anticoagulation was not started [].","[[62.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['29396156', '185006', '15696057', '28797661', '11517106', '34956749']"

Her medical history dates back to 2006 with an infiltrated nodule associated with ulcers that grew gradually in her right thigh. The patient underwent surgery with an anatomopathological study. Skin biopsy objectified ulcerated epidermotropic dermo-hypodermal tumor proliferation whose morphological appearance and immunohistochemical data are in favor of LCH. Langerhans cells present positivity of the anti-PS100 antibody, anti-CD1a antibody, and anti-Ki67 antibody (60%), and negativity of the anti-CD68 antibody. The patient subsequently received 25 sessions of radiotherapy followed by six courses of chemotherapy with a low dose of oral methotrexate. After these treatments, skin lesions are stable. In 2020, the patient complained of an increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of several infiltrating nodules, scaling, crusted papules, and ulcerated plaques. The patient received chemotherapy as single-system LCH (SS-LCH) based on methotrexate, associated with prednisone and vinblastine, with the obtainment of stable response and limited regression of the lesions. After two courses, the patient was lost to follow-up. One year later, the oncologist referred the patient to the hematology department for a major increase in skin lesions, with the appearance of new ones on her thigh. Dermatological examination found ulcers and necrotic lesions, purplish, well-limited, of variable size, not painful, not warm to the skin, and localized to the right thigh. The mucous membranes and integuments were unharmed (Figure ).
Furthermore, the examination found an afebrile, obese patient (body mass index (BMI) at 44.8). Abdominal and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. The physical examination did not find any tumoral syndromes, and the patient did not present have B signs (fever, weight loss, and night sweats). A complete assessment was carried out in favor of a cutaneous location without visceral involvement. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen was normal. Extensive investigation revealed no systemic involvement, central nervous system (CNS) evaluation was not done, serum thyroid hormone levels were normal, endocrine workup was performed, including cortisolemia, and parathormone assessment were done in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism. A skin biopsy was performed. The microscopic examination revealed a cutaneous tissue with an infiltrate of large cells involving the dermis and realizing an epidermotropism. The infiltrate was composed of atypical cells with abundant, pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, irregular and elongated or lobed nuclei with prominent nuclear grooves and folds, fine chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli. Multinucleated giant tumor cells, high cytonuclear atypia, and marked nuclear pleomorphism were seen. The mitotic figures were increased. The neoplastic cells also showed a mixed inflammatory background with variable numbers of reactive lymphocytes, plasma cells, benign histiocytes, and eosinophils associated (Figure ).
The immunohistochemical stains had shown a diffuse strong and heterogeneous positivity for CD1a and S100 and variable positivity for CD45. All other markers studied were negative, including CD68, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and melanocytic marker (MelanA). The Ki-67 proliferation index was high (50%) (Figure ).
In the light of microscopic and phenotypic results, the diagnosis of Langerhans cell sarcoma was confirmed. The patient did not receive any maintenance therapy and she received only two courses of chemotherapy; consequently, the patient was included in the LCH protocol as single-system LCH (SS-LCH), and she received the same chemotherapy combining prednisone (60 mg / m2), high-dose of methotrexate (5000 mg/m2), and vinblastine (10 mg/m2).

Specifically, he stated that his symptoms started four days after receiving his second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine for COVID-19. His first dose taken three weeks earlier was well tolerated. He denied any flank or abdominal pain, melena, fever, cough, hematuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and trauma. He denied smoking. Vital signs were stable upon admission. Physical examination was insignificant for any lower extremity pitting edema, petechiae, or rash. The patient was not on any medication prior to his hospitalization.
Laboratory analysis was remarkable for serum creatinine of 4.1 mg/dL (0.8-1.4 mg/dL) along with hematuria and sub-nephrotic proteinuria of 1796 g/24 hours (<150 mg/24 hours). Our differential diagnosis at this point was wide including all nephritic syndromes given AKI, hematuria and proteinuria. All serological workup was subsequently sent. C-ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were elevated 160 AU/mL (20-25 AU/mL) and anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibodies were also elevated >100 EU/ mL (normal <3.5 EU/mL) (Table ). Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was not performed. All previous routine laboratory parameters including urinalysis were within normal range.

During his first hospitalization, he complained of lumbar pain. On physical examination, he had conjunctival pallor and severe percussion tenderness of his back. No skin lesions or neurological deficits were seen. Laboratory test results were as follows: hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; creatinine, 7.01 mg/dL; total protein, 7.4 g/dL; albumin, 3.2 g/dL; calcium, 14.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 6.2 mg/dL; beta-2-microglobulin, 27.9 mg/L; IgG, 341 mg/dL; IgA, 21 mg/dL; IgM, 18 mg/dL; free kappa light chain, 99,900 mg/L; and free lambda light chain, 9.7 mg/L. Chest X-ray results were normal. Computed tomography (CT) showed vertebral compression fractures of Th8 and L1 and bilateral pleural effusions without calcified lesions. Urine immunoelectrophoresis showed a positive result for the Bence-Jones protein. Bone marrow aspiration revealed plasma cell proliferation (65% of total nucleated cells, ) with expression of CD38 and CD56, absence of CD19 and CD20, and an MIB-1 labeling index of 25%. Chromosomal analysis of the bone marrow by G-banding showed a normal 46,XY karyotype, but fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the abnormalities del(13q) and t(4;14). He was diagnosed with Bence-Jones protein type MM (stage III according to the International Staging System, and stage IIIB according to the Durie–Salmon classification system).
We began treatment with intravenous fluids and intramuscular injections of calcitonin to treat the severe hypercalcemia. Simultaneously, he received bortezomib-dexamethasone (Bd) therapy (subcutaneous injection of 1.3 mg/(m2·day) bortezomib plus 20 mg/day dexamethasone orally on days 1, 4, 8, and 11). Unexpectedly, he experienced severe acute heart failure on day 8, and temporarily required the support of a mechanical ventilator. Bd therapy was discontinued during the first treatment cycle. Because renal function had not improved, maintenance hemodialysis was initiated. Subsequently, we continued MM treatment with two cycles of vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (0.4 mg/body of vincristine and 9 mg/m2 of doxorubicin on days 1 to 4; and 40 mg/body of dexamethasone on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 28-day cycle) and the M2 protocol (multiple chemotherapeutic agents, not including proteasome inhibitors), followed by lenalidomide-dexamethasone (Rd) therapy (5 mg/day lenalidomide on days 1 to 21 plus 20 mg/body dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of a 28-day cycle).
About four months after starting Rd therapy, the patient suffered from myoclonus-like movement of the lower extremities. During the sixth cycle of Rd therapy, he complained of pain in both lower legs, but did not have skin lesions or tenderness. He had been taking loxoprofen, fentanyl (patch and buccal tablet), mecobalamin, ferrous fumarate, lansoprazole, amlodipine, furosemide, alfacalcidol, and darbepoetin alfa. It was unlikely that his pain was drug-induced.
The patient's serum creatinine kinase level was elevated to 1,268 U/L. Diffusion-weighted and short tau inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse high signal intensity in the crural muscles (). A muscle biopsy was performed on the right tibial anterior muscles () and 40 mg/day prednisolone was prescribed by a neurologist because of suspected polymyositis/dermatomyositis. However, typical pathologic findings of polymyositis/dermatomyositis, like lymphocyte infiltration around muscle fibers, were absent and vessel calcification was noted. Prednisolone was ineffective against his symptoms. During steroid administration, well-demarcated ulcers developed on the right lower leg, both exterior thighs, and the penis. These ulcers gradually worsened () and the patient experienced severe pain, especially during dialysis or exercise. He could not continue dialysis because of this exacerbation of pain. Moreover, muscle atrophy of his lower limbs impaired his daily activities. The administration of 40 mg/day prednisolone was continued for 42 days and was then stopped on the 84th day after tapering. The patient's serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 429 pg/mL, while previously it was permissively controlled within the range of 140–250 pg/mL. Before dialysis, his levels of serum albumin, calcium, and phosphate were 4.0 g/dL, 7.4 mg/dL, and 7.9 mg/dL, respectively. He was diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). We could not exclude a relationship between MM and HPT, although his free light chain ratio was decreasing.
CT showed widespread centrilobular opacities of both lungs () and high-density lesions along small blood vessels in the trunk and extremities (), but the mediastinum, abdominal organs, and large vessels like the thoracic and abdominal aorta were intact. A pulmonary function test demonstrated restrictive impairment with reduced diffusion capacity: the predicted forced vital capacity was 48.6%, the forced expiratory volume of the first breath was 87.9%, and the predicted diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide was 67.1%. 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate scintigraphy revealed abnormal diffuse accumulation in both upper lung fields (). Echography revealed no enlargement of the parathyroid glands.
Next, a transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and microscopy confirmed the presence of calcifications of the alveolar walls () and of a small vessel in the right anterior tibial muscle (). However, pathological calcification was absent from the right exterior thigh ulcer. Healing of the skin biopsy wound was delayed.
The patient was ultimately diagnosed with muscle and skin ischemia from CUA. He was treated with cinacalcet, and his intact PTH levels fell to a normal range. He underwent four additional cycles of Rd therapy, but ulcer infections occurred repeatedly in both thighs, occasionally progressing to sepsis. He has since been monitored closely for MM, without treatment, for four months. Meanwhile, the ulcers have achieved epithelialization after topical treatment, but his serum free light chain ratio level increased from 290 to 1532. He is currently undergoing Pd therapy (2 mg/day pomalidomide on days 1 to 21, plus 4 mg/day dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle) without any adverse events. Since severe heart failure occurred during the combined regimen with bortezomib, we have avoided administering proteasome inhibitors. His disease is stable according to the International Myeloma Working Group criteria.","[[51.0, 'year']]",M,"['3639672-1', '3781618-1', '7899288-1', '3600291-1']","['3246115', '13987854', '6228428', '3899657', '15818203', '8645747', '3106683', '3952378', '3815990', '24340476', '20048175', '16568725', '7408364', '2602666', '1190631', '25918645', '23533873', '10792244', '5775001', '8304650', '22551348', '26466702', '836675', '23662234', '21605111', '2652375', '3628862', '3920544', '4076242', '3261406', '12070068', '7113758', '33633910', '24385728', '7135302', '30026990']"
958,6031211-1,30026988,comm/PMC006xxxxxx/PMC6031211.xml,Clinical Application of the Socket-Shield Concept in Multiple Anterior Teeth,"The patient was a 76-year-old man who came to the office in 2014 looking for possible treatments of his fractured central incisors. Nothing was found relevant about his medical condition. The patient shows a high risk for caries and also eccentric bruxism. He has partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings (Figures and ). Then, the posterior superior quadrants needed to be restored with implants.
Three years after, in 2017, the patient came back to the office referring pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. New and secondary subgingival caries were found in the six front teeth. The conservative prognosis was considered poor due to the subgingival depth and extent of decay presented by the lesions from canine to canine. After having discussed the treatment options, especially the surgical lengthening of the front teeth or the orthodontic extrusion, the patient decides to replace the residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge similar to the recently performed prostheses of the posterior areas that were judged by him as a highly satisfactory treatment. The patient preferred not to involve these restorations in the present anterior treatment and limited it to place only two implants in the lateral incisors' positions ().
The treatment was carried out in a staged approach. Briefly, first, we extracted the lateral incisors, using the SST, and placed two immediate implants. The four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the purpose of maintaining the aesthetics and function of the patient during the early osseointegration period. In a further step, the four remaining teeth were also extracted using the SST, and the initial provisional bridge was replaced by the second provisional screwed on the uncovered implants. Only one out of the four abutment teeth used for the temporization of root canal treatment was needed due to a periapical infection.
When placing the two immediate implants into the alveolus of the lateral incisors, a section of the buccal part of the root (about the two middle thirds) was left in place and no biomaterial was used at all. An impression of the implants was taken to have the second temporary bridge available in the second surgery. Healing abutments were then attached with the proper height for the soft tissue to cover them but at the same time facilitating the uncovering. Finally, a temporary acrylic bridge was cemented onto the four abutment teeth 13-11 and 21-23 ().
Three months later, the implants were uncovered, the four abutment teeth were extracted, again with the SST—partial extraction of the roots—but this time no more implants were placed in these sockets. The first provisional cemented onto the teeth was then replaced by a second acrylic bridge screwed onto the implants though temporary abutments ().
The partial extraction of the canines, aiming to leave a buccal slice of the root, was so hard to perform, and further instrumentation would lead to the socket destruction that a decision was intraoperatively made and a greater portion of the root, including the apex, was finally left. As the locations of the canines did not involve the implant sites, any potential complication could be addressed efficiently.
One month later, the prosthodontic phase was undertaken. Little if any differences in the buccal tissue volume and no noticeable aesthetic impact could be found after the multiple extractions (). The desired position of the incisal border was determined by various try-ins, and five months after implant surgery, the definitive prosthesis was placed. The final clinical aspect can be appreciated in the pictures (Figures and ).","[[76.0, 'year']]",M,"['4556801-1', '4556801-2', '4556801-3']","['3083004', '26339525', '23631704', '28402349', '15691354', '23057026', '20712701', '24660198', '6766189', '281517', '29340355', '18092446', '34783912', '28333394', '2585312', '27565228', '28000278', '28604262', '25265125', '24035254', '24894299', '27560672', '22633589', '24777024', '276798', '30026988']"

Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease with three prior myocardial infarctions, recurrent cerebrovascular accidents requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, gastroesophageal reflux disease, asthma, and endometrial cancer status post radiation therapy. Fifteen months prior to the current presentation, the patient was noted to have a grade 1 endometrial adenoma but was not considered a good surgical candidate due to multiple comorbidities. Vaginal hysterectomy was considered but due to her long and narrow vagina, this option was deferred initially. Her only treatment option was radiation therapy and brachytherapy. She eventually underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy due to continued pelvic pain. The patient denied any prior history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Her bleeding was described as one large episode of bright red blood per rectum associated with blood clots. She denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or melena. The most recent colonoscopy was performed four months ago and revealed three diminutive polyps in the transverse colon with pathology confirming tubular adenoma.
Her physical examination was significant for mild left-sided abdominal tenderness but was otherwise unremarkable. Rectal examination was notable for nonbleeding hemorrhoids and no visible blood. Blood work revealed white blood cells of 14.3k/uL (normal range 4.3-10.0 k/uL) and hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL (normal range 11.8-14.8 g/dL), which is similar to the patient’s baseline. Creatinine was slightly elevated to 1.2 and blood urea nitrogen was elevated to 39. International normalized ratio was 2.0. Due the large volume of hematochezia and presence of anemia, the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a large, fungating, friable, and ulcerated nonobstructing mass in the sigmoid colon. The mass was noncircumferential, measured 4 cm in length, and was located 15-19 cm from the anal verge (Figures , ). Biopsies were obtained with cold forceps for histology and the proximal and distal margins of the mass were tattooed. Histology showed invasive and moderately differentiated carcinoma without visible goblet cells. Given the patient’s history of endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry was performed and was consistent with an endometrial (endometrioid subtype) primary.
Pan-computed tomography was negative for any obvious distant disease. The tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal as well. The patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of the affected colon followed by radiation therapy. At a follow-up visit one year later, the patient was doing well without active GI complaints.","[[67.0, 'year']]",F,['5676375-1'],"['21380941', '33433946', '11007036', '33383960', '29209543', '34956768']"

He had high blood pressure, and he started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of hypertensive nephrosclerosis 8 years previously. A PD catheter was primarily inserted at the right abdomen, but it was removed and inserted at the left abdomen because of exit site and tunnel infection 5 years previously. He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.
On physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 ° F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /μL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Additionally, he was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime. The PD catheter was flushed once a day to prevent catheter obstruction with fibrin, and the characteristics of the peritoneal fluid were monitored. His abdominal pain was resolved and peritoneal fluid cell count decreased to < 30/mL, and thus, he resumed oral intake on day 8.
After resumption of oral intake, his abdominal pain worsened and his peritoneal fluid cell count dramatically increased to 9600/mL on day 15. The peritoneal fluid became cloudy with a high amount of fibrin and white blood cells (Fig. ). Although he stopped eating again, his abdominal pain did not improve, and fecal material with foul smell was identified from the PD catheter on day 23 (Fig. ). Culture of peritoneal dialysate on admission was negative; however, culture of peritoneal dialysate on hospital day 23 was positive for Enterococcus faecalis and Bacteroides caccae. On CT, the intestinal contents disappeared and the dilated intestine collapsed, indicating that the intestinal contents had leaked into the abdominal cavity (Fig. ). Considering these facts, intestinal perforation was diagnosed, and he underwent ileocecal resection with colostomy creation. Although intra-abdominal adhesion was severe, fibrinous encapsulation of the bowel, which would suggest EPS, was not detected macroscopically during surgery (Fig. ). As indicators of EPS were not evident, the PD catheter was removed. The perforation site was located at the adhesive intestine. The tip of the peritoneal catheter was located in Douglas’ pouch, and it did not injure the adhesive intestine. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed inflammatory cells associatet with the peritonitis in the intestinal wall. Intestinal fibrosis, arterial alteration, and tissue calcification were not evident pathologically (Fig. , ). Although his serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) level was high (41.05 mg/L), amyloidosis and deposition of B2M were not observed (Fig. -). The postoperative course was uneventful and left arteriovenous fistula surgery was performed on day 42.

Her symptoms were associated with seeing red spots and experiencing a burning sensation in the bottom of her feet. She was concerned because she was having difficulty picking up objects due to her hand symptoms. Her basic lab work was unremarkable, and she was provided gabapentin and magnesium oxide with close follow-up with her primary care physician. At follow-up, she complained of one to two months of unsteady gait as well as increased confusion. Her reported medications included losartan and metformin. Physical exam revealed normal pupils with reaction and accommodation (3mm diameter bilaterally), no cranial nerve deficits, normal strength throughout, and normal reflexes throughout except for diminished reflexes in the bilateral knees and ankles. She endorsed blurry vision; no ophthalmologic exam was performed, but she was able to read a name badge from one foot away. She additionally was found to have decreased vibratory and proprioception in a stocking pattern as well as a wide-based and unsteady gait.
To investigate further, tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), folate, B12, and rapid plasma regain (RPR) titer were ordered. Her TSH, folate, and B12 levels were within normal limits, but her RPR titer was reactive at 1:1. A subsequent reflex Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test was reactive. She was told to go to the hospital for further workup and treatment. Further questioning revealed that she had had two sexual partners in her life, both ex-husbands. However, she noted that her husbands committed adultery several times and that she was not currently sexually active; her last sexual encounter occurred several years ago. She endorsed that she did not notice any ulcers or skin lesions, and she had not been treated for syphilis. During hospitalization, she received a lumbar puncture that revealed a negative venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test result. Her glucose level (61 mg/dL) and white blood cell level (3 x 109/L) were normal, but her CSF protein level was markedly elevated at 156 mg/dL. Due to her exposure history, a constellation of symptoms, RPR titer with positive TP-PA, and protein elevation in her CSF, our infectious disease colleagues believed that she contracted syphilis earlier in life from one of her husbands and was never treated. The decision was made to start treatment with intravenous (IV) penicillin (24 million units, continuous infusion) for two weeks. At follow-up, her vision had improved and she no longer had sensory symptoms in her hands. Her gait was somewhat improved, but still unsteady, and she still had burning pain in her feet. Her physical exam showed improvement in sensation in hands and improved gait; all other neurological exam was unchanged. It was thought that neuropathy in feet could have been due to poorly controlled diabetes; although, no formal nerve conduction study was pursued.","[[71.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['31577877', '15477572', '25387188', '29986091', '34956758']"

On physical examination, she was found to be febrile with a temperature of 38.4°C, her pulse was 112 beats/min and blood pressure 99/61. Examination also revealed a laparotomy scar with an epigastric dehiscence exposing a part of the stomach which has a small defect.

Examination was unremarkable except tachypnea (30 breaths per min). Arterial blood gas analysis showed low partial pressure of oxygen (57.2 mmHg on room air). Her brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 680 pg/ml, and troponin I level was 0.17 ng/ml. An electrocardiogram showed ST-T wave abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography displayed a dilated right ventricle (right ventricular internal diameter: 44 mm) with a “D-shaped” left ventricle, elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (154 mmHg), and patent ductus arteriosus. The diagnosis was pregnancy, severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), cardiac failure (New York Heart Association III), and acute respiratory failure (type I). Her medication was started with 25 mg sildenafil, three times daily, and 1.25 ng/kg/min treprostinil. Treprostinil dose was progressively increased to 17 ng/kg/min. One week later, her pregnancy was terminated, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit. As a result of continuous deterioration, she experienced sudden cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was applied immediately along with invasive ventilation. Inotropic support with dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine was initiated. A VA-ECMO support with a flow of 3–3.5 L/min was indicated simultaneously. The VA-ECMO consisted of a standard pump/oxygenation combination (BE-PLS 2050, MAQUET Cardiopulmonary GmbH, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) and inflow/outflow cannulas (CB96570/96670-015, Medtronic Inc., Michigan, USA). UFH with an infusion rate of 3–13 units/kg/h was used for anticoagulation to maintain a target ACT in the range of 180–220 s and APTT in a range of 35–75 s. In addition, ambrisentan at a daily dose of 5 mg was supplied to control PAH. Thereafter, the systolic pulmonary artery pressure was controlled between 86 to 96 mmHg, and normal ventricles were observed by echocardiography. On day 5 of ECMO, platelet count decreased abruptly from 147.5x109/L to 28x109/L. Platelet transfusion was performed, but the platelet counts further dropped to a nadir of 19x109/L at day 9 of ECMO. HIT was therefore suspected, although the patient did not develop any thrombotic event. The pretest clinical scoring system, the 4T’s (), was used to identify the possibility of HIT in the patient. The score was 5 points, indicating intermediate probability of HIT. Two days later (day 11 of ECMO), platelet factor 4 (PF-4)/heparin antibody titred by latex enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (ACL-TOP700 automatic coagulation analyzer, Beckman Coulter, California, United States) returned to a positive result of 8.7 units/ml (normal range 0–1 units/ml). Thus, HIT was diagnosed in the patient. The patient received therapeutic plasma exchange with a flow of 1,200–1,500 ml/h for 2.5 h for PF-4/heparin antibody removal from her blood, despite plasma exchange was not a recommended treatment for HIT and it was occasionally used in patients with acute HIT (). Meanwhile, anticoagulation was then performed using bivalirudin (TAIJIANING; SALUBRIS Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China). Initially, bivalirudin was used with a dose of 0.23 mg/kg/h and was titrated according to ACT and APTT. The average dose of bivalirudin used was 0.005–0.03 mg/kg/h with continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) and 0.03–0.15 mg/kg/h without CRRT (). Target ACT (200–250 s) and APTT (40–60 s) were managed easily with bivalirudin and no supplemental boluses were needed (). The titre of anti-PF4/heparin antibody gradually reduced and returned to negative (0.3 units/ml) on the day 33 of UFH withdrawal. The platelet counts gradually increased and remained stable (70–90 x109/L) throughout the infusion of bivalirudin (). The patient was successfully weaned off ECMO after a total of 42 days. During the ECMO support procedure, 39 units of platelet concentrates, 59 units of red blood cells, and 7.6 L of fresh frozen plasma were transfused. The oxygenator was changed twice, while the circuits were changed once. Bivalirudin infusion was stopped 12 h later, and the ACT decreased to a value of 180 s within 4 h. The total duration of bivalirudin was 31 days.

She was brought by her parent to the psychiatric clinic with a 3-year history of the cyclical presentation of a short episode of clouded sensorium and abrupt onset of psychosis. Her thoughts and emotions had been impaired to the extent that her family had begun to believe that she had been ‘possessed’ by a malevolent spirit. Her mother noted that her distress occurred during the second half of her menstrual cycle and ended at the onset of menstrual bleeding. During the second half of her menstrual cycle, AA was reported as showing symptoms of dysphoric mania, isolating herself and crying unremittingly without substantive reason. The episodes of negativistic behavior tended to be superseded by a state of overactivity and euphoria characterized by grandiose beliefs, inappropriate irritability and social behavior and increased talking speed or volume. AA’s symptoms were reported to recede upon the onset of menstrual bleeding. While sedulous dating was not feasible, she was described to have had approximately 6–8 episodes of ‘possession’ in a year, with a regular occurrence every month.
She had no relevant medical history and denied having a family background of persistent mental disorders. She also denied having consumed any mind-altering substances including tobacco or its rejuvenated forms and alcohol. A routine urine drug screening did not reveal the presence of any illicit drugs in her system.
Premorbid, AA met her developmental milestones without difficulty. AA had her first menstrual cycle at the age of 13 with regular cycles. She acquired 12 years of formal education and graduated with a secondary school leaving certificate with average performance. But due to her recurring distress, she did not seek further education or employment.
During her consultation in our unit (taking place after the onset of menstrual bleeding), the clinical team noted that she was asymptomatic, interactive and socially active. She informed the clinical team that she tended to have ‘strange feelings’ and ‘weird experiences’ starting during the second half of her menstrual cycle. Overall, she expressed foggy awareness of her recurring distress.
Physical examination was unremarkable and her medical workup—hormonal study, brain computerized tomography (CT) scan, and electroencephalogram (EEG)—was inconclusive. She was also subjected to neuropsychological testing and evaluation of mood (see Fig. ). AA scored 23 on the []. Such a score implied the presence of moderate depressive symptoms.
Olanzapine (5 mg)—an antipsychotic—was instituted once every day to which she was deemed to be compliant. The clinical team noted that the severity of her distress significantly receded but still manifested in episodes of screaming and lability and, as often the case, dissipated upon the start of menstrual bleeding. As the symptoms appeared to be atypical to those featured in CIDI, the clinical team suggested the tentative diagnosis of a manic episode, unspecified (F309)/brief psychotic disorder (F24). During the subsequent follow-up, her antipsychotic, olanzapine, was tapered up to 10 mg once daily and it was noted that the patterns of her symptoms appeared to generally be aligned with her menstrual cycle.
During subsequent follow-up (6 months later), it appeared that her distress was exacerbated after approximately 28 days.

Her respiratory symptoms started at 10 year of age with transient cough and chest pain. Her physical examination showed decreased air entry to the left (L) side. On chest X-ray (CXR), she had L volume loss with mediastinal shift and hyperinflation of the right (R) lung as shown in Figure . Echocardiography demonstrated small L pulmonary artery (PA); however, her L PV was not seen. There were no signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH). At that time, she was treated conservatively. A year later, she developed persistent hemoptysis.
On admission, her vital signs were normal other than fever. She had decreased air entry to the L base with no increased respiratory effort or clubbing. Laboratory investigations (CBC, coagulation factors, blood gases, ferritin, and sputum culture) were normal. Chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed L pulmonary hypoplasia with diffuse parenchymal abnormalities including patchy ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening attributed to pulmonary hemorrhage, a small L PA, and tiny mediastinal collateral vessels. The L PVs were not seen near the L atrium (LA). CTA is shown in Figure .
During her admission, hemoptysis progressed. Urgent bronchoscopy revealed diffuse bleeding from the lower division of the L lower bronchus. It was treated with 1% xylocaine and adrenaline with no improvement. A V/Q scan showed decreased perfusion and ventilation of the L lung (6% and 19%, respectively) as shown in Figure .
Due to persistent hemoptysis and minimal perfusion, she had a L pneumonectomy.
Histopathology showed an extremely fibrotic L lung. The L PV was diminished in size. The lung had a normal weight with normal alveolar structures. Dilated pleural collaterals resembling pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) were noted by the surgeon. Pathology showed a left lower lobe parenchymal hemorrhage, left upper lobe focal consolidation with fibrosis, and focal segmental cystic lymphangiectasia compatible with a diagnosis of unilateral pulmonary vein atresia (UPVA). The cause of bleeding was attributed to venous infarction or rupture of collateral circulation or abnormal anastomoses. Gross pathology picture is shown in Figure .

Although her pain initially occurred late during activity and was resolved with rest, it finally became more constant until it was present at rest (Table ). She received right cementless bipolar hip hemiarthroplasty (BHA) in her local hospital 18 years earlier due to a right femoral neck fracture and had a history of 2-year alendronate (35 mg/wk) use. Radiography showed a radiolucent space surrounding the distal portion of the stem with reactive lines, accompanying localized lateral cortical thickening and an obscure transverse lucent line just above the stem tip (Figure ). At 3 years prior to this episode, she visited our hospital for left-sided sciatic pain with magnetic resonance imaging only indicating mild spinal canal stenosis of the L5-S1. She presented no pain or other symptoms in her right leg during that time. Therefore, we accessed the conventional anteroposterior radiographs of the hip joint taken at the time of the lumbar magnetic resonance imaging scan. Reactive lines and radiolucencies were already apparent, and there were no signs of progressive component migration during these past 3 years (Figure ), even though no beaking of the lateral cortex was observed in this earlier radiograph (Figure ). One possible cause of her severe thigh pain could be aseptic loosening of the stem as plain radiography showed a periprosthetic zone of radiolucency around the bone-implant interface. Another possibility was that the incomplete stress fracture with specific features reflective of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs) was responsible for the painful hip arthroplasty. Tam et al reported that comparing the pattern of uptake with previous bone scintigraphy studies is important to determine loosening. A higher intensity around the prosthesis compared with the previous studies may raise the suspicion of aseptic loosening. Conversely, should no increased uptake on delayed bone scintigraphy exist, significant loosening is unlikely. Furthermore, acute fractures or unstable and unfused old fractures were reported to show increased uptake on bone scintigraphy. Furthermore, we examined her right thigh with [18F] NaF PET/CT to investigate the cause of the pain. NaF PET/CT demonstrated focal intense tracer uptake at the beaking of the lateral cortex; however, only mild radiotracer uptake was observed even in the radiolucent space around the distal portion of the stem (Figure ), suggesting that the cause of the pain was probably due to AFF-like incomplete stress fracture. Hence, we performed open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a locking plate. We chose a reversed locking compression plate for the distal femur (LCP distal femur plate; Depuy Synthes) for the contralateral side and an LCP cable system (Figure ). Alendronate treatment was discontinued and teriparatide (20 µg/d) was started following surgery. We prescribed a rehabilitation program including immediate, gradually augmented weight-bearing, and she reported alleviation of pain a couple of weeks following surgery. Unfortunately, bone healing such as callus formation or fracture line disappearance could not be confirmed on radiograph due to overlapping incomplete fracture site and LCP plate. One and half year following surgery, we reperformed NaF PET/CT scan again, and it showed a markedly reduced NaF uptake at the lateral cortex near the distal stem tip (Figure ). Unexpectedly, the high intensity around the distal screws was observed in contrast to low uptake along the distal stems. In addition, anteroposterior radiography of the right femur performed simultaneously, also showed radiolucent zones around the distal screws (Figure ). These findings indicated that hardware micromotion may have induced high bone metabolic activity, resulting in high concentrations of NaF on PET around the distal screws. She is currently (2.5 years postoperatively) under observation and ambulates independently with no complications (Table ).","[[77.0, 'year']]",F,"['6553561-1', '6553561-2', '6553561-3', '4972725-1', '4972725-2', '4972725-3', '4427957-1']","['27536624', '31183095', '34584712', '9520899', '15457412', '22733959', '12470040', '8713911', '24047953', '20842676', '25943378', '23712442', '32983470']"

Each episode was self-resolving, typically lasting 1-3 days. Investigations, including urinalysis and serum creatinine, had been previously unremarkable in between clinical episodes.
HIV infection had been diagnosed 12 years prior to the current presentation, predating the earliest onset of febrile hematuric episodes by approximately 2 years. Circulating retroviral load was persistently below the detectable threshold by polymerase chain reaction since commencing cART 5 years prior. The decision to commence cART had been made in accordance with the evolution of international HIV treatment guidelines rather than any clinical or hematological indication.
The febrile episodes started approximately 10 years prior and typically occurred 2-3 times per year, though more recently had increased to once every 1-2 months, which prompted presentation for assessment. There was a significant decrement in renal function noted with a serum creatinine of 160 μmol/L (eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), from 94 μmol/L (eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73m2) one year prior. Investigation during an acute febrile episode demonstrated proteinuria (uPCR 80 mg/mmol) with hematuria (urinary erythrocytes > 1000 × 10^6/L) of glomerular morphology. Testing for co-existent infections including hepatitis B and C, Syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, Brucella, Rickettsia, Q fever, strongyloides, mycobacterium tuberculosis, parvovirus, and malaria were all negative, as was screening for familial Mediterranean fever and porphyria. There was serological evidence of previous EBV and CMV exposure, but not of active or recent infection. There was no other past medical history of note, including no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
A renal biopsy was obtained showing renal cortex without any interstitial fibrosis or interstitial inflammation (Figure ). A total of 36 glomeruli were present, none of which were globally sclerosed. By light microscopy, glomeruli showed a focal (10 glomeruli) mild segmental increase in mesangial cellularity. There was no endocapillary proliferation, no segmental sclerosis, no wire loops, no basement membrane spiking or hyaline thrombi. There were no crescents or necrotizing lesions. Immunoperoxidase stains showed granular capillary basement membrane staining for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C1q with weak focal mesangial staining for IgA, IgG, and C1q. Electron microscopy was not performed.
Concurrent serological testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith, and anti-double stranded DNA. Serum levels of C3 and C4 were within the normal laboratory reference range, and rheumatoid factor was not detectable. Given his history of HIV positivity and negative systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) serology, a diagnosis of HIV-associated lupus-like glomerulonephritis was made.
Multiple treatment options including active surveillance and systemic corticosteroids were considered and discussed with the patient. There was a general reluctance expressed by the patient to utilize systemic corticosteroids, due to perceived burden of adverse effects. Given an established role in the treatment of LN and favorable side effect profile, a trial of mycophenolic acid (MPA) was also offered. Following informed consent, 1 gram of oral mycophenolate mofetil was commenced twice a day. Since commencing MPA the patient has experienced a dramatic reduction in frequency of febrile hematuric episodes, with only a single event now 12 months into treatment. Biochemical renal function has also returned to the previous baseline with a serum creatinine of 90 μmol/L (eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73m2).","[[34.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['9324032', '29957821', '14524582', '22553077', '31260149', '15732281', '26786550', '29219816', '28638104', '25183936', '28638105', '29398134', '10070907', '8301934', '15780090', '30675443', '18212779', '23685946', '24343580', '25120835', '26812129', '21083386', '25234519', '32983458']"

Along these 28 weeks after the beginning of lenalidomide, only 6 red blood cells (RBC) units were transfused (Figure ), and no transfusion was required in the subsequent 47 weeks since the hemoglobin level was above 90 g/L. However, due to the subsequent decrease in the hemoglobin level, RBC transfusions were later reinitiated, but with a lower frequency (2 units of RBC every 2 months), in association with lenalidomide. In other words, over the 20 months of treatment with lenalidomide, the RBC requirements were drastically reduced.

ipilimumab therapy in advanced melanoma patient: CT scan and MRI help in
managing difficult clinical decision","In February 2014, a 66-year-old female patient underwent locoregional surgery to
remove a nodular melanoma (Breslow thickness 3.5 mm, Clark's Level IV,
non-ulcerated, 1–6 mitosis/mm) from the left forearm followed by an
ipsilateral axillary lymph-node dissection (2 on 20 lymph-nodes were positive for
malignant cell). A subsequent total body CT scan (CTs) showed no distant metastasis
leading to a final TNM staging of pT3N1aM0. 1 year later ca., in June 2015, disease
relapsed with two massive left subclavian nodal metastasis treated with local
excision. After surgery, the patient agreed to join an institutional clinical trial
with intravenous Ipilimumab administration (10 mg/kg) as adjuvant therapy for
1 year. The first dose of Ipilimumab was administered on 03/08/2015 and the last
dose on 07/07/2016 for a total of 51 administrations; the patient withheld
Ipilimumab administration during this period just two times for personal reasons.
After 2 month of immunotherapy, in October 2015, the patient developed multiple
hilar lung adenopathies () and, from April 2016, the patient suffered from
numerous lung micronodules with perilymphatic and miliary distribution with
predominance in the mid/upper lobes bilaterally. Perilymphatic distribution is
characterized by the involvement of central and peripheral interstitium.
Centrolobular nodules and small micronodules along the bronchovascular bundles are
typical features of central interstitium involvement while micronodules in the
subpleuric regions or along interlobar fissures and interlobular septa are
attributable to peripheral interstitium implication (). Moreover, mostly in the peripheral
regions, several micronodules showed the tendency to converge in a single pulmonary
nodule; these types of nodules are characterized by a very dense center and by more
rare micronodules in the periphery resulting in an irregular nodular border leading
to the typical galaxy sign found in sarcoidosis (). As the patient referred intermittent mild hacking cough,
mild dyspnea and mild malaise with low-grade fever, the findings were interpreted as
lung marks of a inflammatory episode and the patient continued the usual
instrumental follow-up. Afterwards, on July 2016, a scheduled restaging CT scan
showed important splenomegaly, with bipolar diameter 13.5 cm, and the onset of
outnumbered splenic subcentimetric hypodensities evocative for metastatic lesions
(). A contrast-enhanced
abdominal MR was then performed to characterize the lesions: splenic nodules were
hypointense on T2 weighing and scarcely clear on
T1 weighing without any contrast enhancement on the
dynamic sequences (). These MR findings were equivocal and
attributable both to an inflammatory or hematologic process or to metastatic
lesions. Blood exams showed no significant modifications, especially LDH, so the
patient performed a positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-labeled
fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG), that showed no pathological uptakes all over the body
(). Based on radiological, clinical
and blood test data radiologists then suspected a sarcoidosis-like scenario as an
immune-related adverse event (irAE) triggered by Ipilimumab. Therefore, at the
multidisciplinary meeting of the melanoma board, we decided to avoid any invasive
procedure or splenectomy and to keep the patient on strict instrumental follow-up. 1
month later, the patient underwent another contrast-enhanced abdominal MR that
showed disease stability as long as subsequents instrumental follow-up with contrast
enhanced CTs. On November 2016, bilateral hilar adenopaties spontaneously started to
reduce and disappeared on April 2017 (), as long as the bilateral lung nodules (). To be noticed that bilateral faint mosaic attenuation pattern
areas persisted in the lungs for a further 4 months before disappearing completely.
In the first instance this manifestation was attributed to a small airway disease,
in all probability a granulomatous bronchiolitis, a well-known manifestation of
pulmonary sarcoidosis. Finally, on restaging CT scan performed in January 2017, no
more splenic lesions were clear. It must be specified that the patient did not
suffer from any autoimmune disease, such as sarcoidosis, before starting Ipilimumab
therapy.","[[66.0, 'year']]",F,"['5810034-1', '5810034-2', '5810034-3']","['26337719', '25610749', '27403706', '22493370', '12672326', '29433571', '18832811', '26241053', '26981243', '29644214', '30464684', '19365109', '18021432', '24278787', '20525992', '33029362']"

Pain onset was abrupt and showed an aggravation trend. Thus, she performed a brain Computerized Tomography (CT) scan that was normal. According to the clinical and neurological examination, the patient was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia and CMM therapy with carbamazepine (200 mg 3 times/day) and gabapentin (300 mg 3 times/day) was initiated. Nonetheless, the patient reported no symptoms remission. She then performed dental consultancy and was subjected to extraction of the last 2 molars of both right dental arches. With time, the patient began to complain of hypoesthesia of the II and III branches of the right trigeminal nerve, dysphagia for both solids and liquids, episodes of blurred bilateral vision lasting a few seconds with orthostatic hypotension. On September 2006, she performed a contrast-enhanced brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that showed the presence of an extra-axial expansive lesion likely to be a petroclival meningioma. On November 2006, she underwent surgery to remove the lesion in an Institute in Milan. Neurological examination following surgery disclosed a deficiency of the right abducens and trochlear nerves, right hearing loss, mild dysarthria and dysphagia; moreover, herpes labialis and oral candidiasis were reported. At the 1-month follow-up, a partial deficiency of the right facial nerve and keratoconjunctivitis in the right eye were also appreciable. Moreover, the patient reported burning dysesthesia localized to all right trigeminal branches and typical right trigeminal neuralgia in the second branch. CMM therapy with amitriptyline (30 mg/day) was started, in addition to carbamazepine (at the same dosage practiced before) and analgesics whenever needed (not specified). Nine months later (September 2007), the patient underwent thermorhizotomy of the interested branches with a slight improvement of the symptomatology. An intrathecal morphine pump was implanted on January 2008, but the patient experienced serious reactions to morphine that convinced to a switch to ziconotide on March 2008. However, the patient was sent back to a pain therapist because she reported nausea and vomiting, thus preventing ziconotide dosage increase. In the same year, the patient underwent radiosurgery (Gamma Knife or Cyber Knife) with no benefits. The patient continued the same CMM up to 2013, when a SCS with tonic stimulation was implanted at C3-C4 level. The patient reported paresthesia on the right side with a 30% reduction in pain intensity. This was however followed by no further improvements. Moreover, paresthesia became bothersome with time, spreading also to the lower limbs, thus inducing clinicians to turn the device off. In May 2017, the patient came to our attention. Neurological examination disclosed neuropathy and neuralgia of all branches of the right trigeminal nerve, and an impairment of the right trochlear, abducens, facial and auditory nerves. CMM was nearly ineffective to control pain and right-side hypoesthesia. The numeric rating scale (NRS; 0 = no pain; 10 = the worst pain imaginable) was 10. In particular, the patient described her pain as debilitating and characterized by electric shocks and allodynia on the II and III branches. She cannot feed herself adequately due to difficulty in chewing or speaking lasting since long time. In addition, the patient was experiencing sleep disorders and started making regular use of hypnotic-sedatives. A brain MRI on August 2017 confirmed the presence of residual known pathological tissue following the ablation of the right petroclival meningioma, which was morpho-volumetrically substantially unchanged compared to the previous control on December 2011. A blink reflex (BR) examination disclosed delayed ipsilateral and contralateral responses when stimulating the right supra-orbital nerve, thus confirming the dysfunction of the right trigeminal nerve (Fig. ). CMM therapy included pregabalin (75 mg bid), pantoprazole (20 mg/day), alprazolam (0.25 mg bid), lacosamide 50 mg (1 cp bid), amitriptyline (35 mg/day). On September 2017, we re-positioned the SCS leads from C3-C4 (Fig. ) to C1-C2; tonic stimulation was maintained. However, no improvements were reported at the end of the trial period, while paresthesia became bothersome and spread to the lower limbs.
On December 2018, we provided the patient with an HFSCS trial (Fig. ). Prior to implantation, routine blood tests and cardiological examination with ECG were required. Furthermore, an X-ray of the cervical spine was performed to check the post-intervention electro catheters positioning. Soon after HFSCS implantation, the patient had an improvement in the electric shocks like pain component on the inner side of right cheek up to a complete pain relief within 15 days, so that she could again brush her right dental arch and chew without feeling the strongly debilitating shocks.

The patient had never experienced paroxysms of headache, palpitation, excessive sweating, flushing, or other commonly associated symptoms of pheochromocytoma. His blood pressure was 125/85 mm Hg on admission. The family history was negative for neuroendocrine diseases, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 and 2, and other heredity and possible syndrome-related tumors. His ophthalmological examinations were normal, except unilateral 23-mm proptosis.
The patient did not have abnormal hormonal and biochemical values including TSH, T3, T4, prolactin, FSH, LH, blood sugar, Na, K, Ca, and phosphor. Thus, we requested an orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Figure ). The MRI revealed a 19 × 17 mm intracanal space-occupying lesion in the inferomedial aspect of the right orbit with mass effect on the optic nerve and upward impression of the right inferior rectus muscle. The mass was biopsied, and subsequent histopathology and immunohistochemistry (ICH) studies were as follows: Predominantly inflamed fibromuscular tissue fragments showed aggregates of polygonal cells with areas of polymorphism and atypical nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, which in turn showed positive immunostaining for synaptophysin (SYN). These findings were in favor of neuroendocrine tumor such as metastasis of malignant pheochromocytoma. Also, the 24-hours urine study showed a small increase in vanillylmandelic acid and normetanephrine of 8.1 mg/24 h (normal 2-7 mg/24 h) and 290.1 mcg/24 h (normal: 44-261 mcg/24 h in normotensive males), respectively.
The abdominopelvic computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral manifestations of pheochromocytoma: a hypodense mass with ring enhancement in the right hepatorenal space with fat stranding in pre-renal fat (size: 113 × 110 mm) and a hypodense mass in the location of the left adrenal gland (size: 142 × 109 mm). Then, the patient underwent laparotomy and tumor resection. The histopathological examination of tissues showed prominent foci of necrosis and focal desmoplastic stroma, which predominantly had foci of a sheet-like pattern. IHC staining was positive for vimentin, SYN (Figures , , ), Ki67 (about 5%-6% in some areas), S100 (in some tumor cells), and creatine kinase (CK, weakly positive). Also, it was negative for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), calretinin, desmin, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), inhibin, LCA, CD3, CD20, CD10, and HMB-45.
The entirety of pathological examination was in line with our previous diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma. According to the Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score (PASS), both masses had a score of 9, indicating a potential for aggressive behavior.
The patient received 17 cycles of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine regimen. But unfortunately, painful right globe tumor did not show any significant response to this treatment. Thus, brachytherapy technique was applied to the ocular tumor margin in nine 4 Gy bid fractions over five consecutive days as a palliative measure. One year after this treatment, urine metanephrines and VMA, as well as imaging studies, remained unchanged, no new metastasis was suspected, the patient's ocular pain was improved, and the right eye vision remained unaffected. The final diagnosis of this case was nonfunctioning to barely functioning malignant pheochromocytoma with metastases to the eye muscle.","[[47.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['30769931', '7740432', '12165664', '14500403', '8849581', '16091986', '21556209', '10526289', '31220678', '5437826', '12350402', '28748315', '31211069', '11030207', '32983478']"

The patient also mentioned a four-week history of dysphagia both in liquids and solids. Physical examination revealed a horizontal nystagmus in the left-eye-position, a reduced swallowing reflex, a left-sided hemiparesis with 4/5 muscle strength and a left-sided dysmetria and asynergia. His past medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. The rest medical history was unremarkable.
The initial diagnostic workup included a brain computed tomography (CT) which revealed a right temporal lobe tumor extending into the basal ganglia as well. Further evaluation with a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a highly vascularized tumor in the aforementioned area, with an irregular gadolinium ring enhancement and surrounding edema (Figure ).
At that moment, a diagnosis of a high-grade glioma was suspected. He was treated with high dosage of intravenous dexamethasone and clinical improvement was gradually noted. Even though a primary brain lesion was most likely the case, the patient also underwent thoracic and abdomen computed tomography and the possibility of a secondary brain tumor was excluded at that stage. In further investigation, the presence of a high-grade glioma, and probably a glioblastoma, was suggested by a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). During patient’s hospitalization (day 3) a sudden neurological deterioration occurred as he developed a left hemianopia with a 2/5 left-sided hemiparesis. The new brain CT scan revealed a new hypointense lesion in the right occipital lobe without hemorrhagic findings and the diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) confirmed a recent right posterior cerebral infarct (Figure ). Thrombolysis was not performed due to high bleeding risk of the tumor and secondary stroke prevention with acetylsalicylic acid was administered at that moment. Patient’s neurological status, in terms of left-sided hemiparesis, was gradually improved and a few days later he was transferred to the neurosurgery department for surgery planning and further treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","[[68.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['21489628', '20350972', '20038772', '15726266', '21603965', '24571837', '26306931', '10526083', '29472157', '26988080', '19774387', '23763899', '26272599', '12588929', '18541885', '3842081', '10673524', '32953333']"

As bone marrow transplantation was not available during her childhood, she had been treated with corticosteroids and monthly blood transfusions, leading to a hepatitis C virus infection when she was 18 years old. At that time, a liver biopsy was performed and evidenced hepatic siderosis (grade 4), as well as mild fibrosis. She underwent hepatitis C treatment and reached a sustained virological response.
In addition, she had amenorrhoea with a further diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Her daily prescription included deferasirox, deferoxamine, insulin and levothyroxine, with irregular adherence to treatment. In April 2019, she presented a non-complicated tooth infection, which required treatment with amoxicillin. A few days later, she complained of fatigue, dyspnoea, jaundice and lower limbs oedema, which progressively worsened over the next 15 days, and she was referred to our centre on suspicion of acute liver failure.
Physical examination revealed bilateral jugular stasis, liver enlargement, ascites, jaundice and lower limbs oedema. Pulmonary sounds were abolished on the right base. There was no fever or signs of a tooth abscess.
Initial laboratory tests showed normocytic and normochromic anaemia (haemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, normal range [NR] > 12.0) with a reduced number of reticulocytes (20 × 106/mm3, NR 50–100 × 106) and thrombocytopenia (41,000/mm3, NR > 150,000). The levels of serum ferritin were very high (21,973 ng/mL, NR 13–150), with transferrin saturation of 102%. Liver enzymes were slightly elevated: aspartate aminotransferase 195 U/L (NR < 35), alanine aminotransferase 183 U/L (NR < 35), alkaline phosphatase 181 U/L (NR < 104) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 84 U/L (NR < 40). Liver function tests were abnormal: total bilirubin 11.4 mg/dL (NR 0.3–1.2), direct bilirubin 5.6 (NR < 0.2), albumin 3.0 g/L, (NR 3.5–5.2) and international normalised ratio 1.81 (NR < 1.25). There was also a reduction in serum levels of sodium (132 mmol/L, NR 135–145), phosphate (2.9 mg/dL, NR 3.5–5.1), magnesium (0.99 mg/dL, NR 1.6–2.1) and parathyroid hormone (8.0 pg/mL, NR 15–65). Renal function, thyroid hormones, ceruloplasmin and gamma-globulin were normal. Viral serologies for hepatitis A and B were negative, as was the hepatitis C viral load.
Abdominal ultrasonography showed hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous parenchyma, enlarged hepatic veins and ascites. The bile ducts and the portal vein were normal. Computed tomography showed heart enlargement, bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. a) without thrombosis in the pulmonary arteries, as well as hepatomegaly and ascites (Fig. b) without portal vein thrombosis. Further analysis of pleural effusion was compatible with transudate, according to Light’s criteria []. Ascitic fluid was not assessed because of the reduced volume. An echocardiogram revealed cardiomegaly, an ejection fraction of 28%, global dysfunction of the left and right ventricles, marked pulmonary arterial hypertension (medium 50 mmHg), mild tricuspid reflux and concentric left ventricular remodelling.
The patient presented sustained episodes of tachypnoea, desaturation and tachycardia. There was no response to treatment for decompensated congestive heart failure with diuretics and even the use of vasoactive drugs (dobutamine and noradrenaline). Blood, urine and pleural fluid cultures were negative. The patient received empirical antibiotics, despite no signs of active infection. Her serum bilirubin rose to 25 mg/dL. Although the liver morphology did not suggest advanced fibrosis by imaging exams, the patient manifested clinical features of ACLF. Unfortunately, her condition evolved to respiratory failure and she died on the 17th in-hospital day.

Case Report,"A 6-years-old female Staffordshire terrier was referred for periodic generalized seizures and asymmetric visual deficit. Due to her neurologic signs, the local vet recommended an MRI examination, which was performed using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T with a Siemens Head/Neck 20 3T TIM coil, Erlangen, Germany).
Before scanning, the dog was sedated using a 22 G intravenous catheter (Vygonüle V Luer-Lock; Laboratories Pharmaceutiques Vygon, France) that was placed in the lateral saphenous vein of the right hind limb. The dog was premedicated with medetomidine-hidroklorid (0.5 mL Narco Start 1 mg/mL A.U.V., Le Vet B.V., The Netherlands). Following premedication, anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/bwkg propofol intravenously (Propofol 1% MCT/LCT, 5.5 mg/bwkg, Fresenius-Kabi). The following sequences were made: T2-weighted sagittal view of the head; FLAIR transversal; and pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted MPRAGE.
The MRI revealed that the lateral ventricles were moderately enlarged, and dorsal to the lateral ventricles at the midline, there were three fluid-filled cystic structures. The most caudal was 11.5 × 7.5 mm, the cranial was 4.3 mm, and the middle was 8.5 × 2.4 mm in diameter. The plexus choroideus almost completely occupied the middle region of the right lateral ventricle and invaded the left lateral ventricle. The plexus choroideus had irregular borders and a “cauliflower-like” appearance. The proliferating choroid plexus on T1- and T2-weighted images was isointense with the cerebral gray matter, while on FLAIR images, it was slightly hyperintense. On all sequences it contained well-circumscribed areas of low signal intensity. It was intensely enhanced on the post-contrast T1-weighted images. On the FLAIR images, there was a 5 × 6 mm area of increased signal intensity medial to the pars centralis of the right lateral ventricle (caudal to the largest cystic structure). The optic nerves with their surroundings and the cerebellum were normal (). Presumed radiological differential diagnosis included the following diseases: choroid plexus papilloma, choroid plexus carcinoma, atypical choroid plexus papilloma, ependymoma, astrocytoma (subependymal giant cell or pilocytic).
After the MRI, the dog was referred for neurologic examination and surgery. Neurologic examination revealed an absent menace response and direct pupillary reflex on the right. Other cranial reflexes were normal, mental state, behavior, body posture and gait did not show any abnormalities. Proprioception and hopping tests were unremarkable. All spinal reflexes were normal. Blood and urine tests revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal and heart ultrasound findings were normal. A survey chest radiograph showed no sign of metastasis. According to the neurological examination and history the neurological localization was left sided occipital lobe, multifocal lesions in the brain. Following differential diagnosis were presumed. Vascular (ischemic) event, inflammation (MUO/MUE), anomaly (hydrocephalus), idiopathic epilepsy, neoplasia with or without altered fluid circulation.
During the surgery, the dog was positioned in sternal recumbency, and the head was elevated to ensure blood outflow. Fentanyl (5 μg/bwkg, Richter Gedeon), dormicum (0.05 mg/bwkg, EGIS), and ketamine (CP Ketamin 10% injection AUV, Medicus Partner) injections were used for premedication. The induction drug was propofol (Propofol 1% MCT/LCT, 5.5 mg/bwkg, Fresenius-Kabi), and anesthesia was maintained with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen gas (Isoflutek 1,000 mg/g, 1.5 v/v %, Laboratorios Karizoo). During the surgery, fentanyl-ketamine (Fentanyl: 5 μg/bwkg, Richter Gedeon, Ketamin: CP Ketamin 10% injection AUV, Medicus Partner) infusion was maintained with an infusion pump (1 mL fentanyl + 0.06 mL ketamine/100 mL infusion with a rate of 100 mL/10 bwkg/h). The hair on the head was shaved off, and the head was prepared by the aseptic method. Median skin incision was performed from the protuberantia occipitalis externa to the point of Bregma. The middle and caudal auricular muscle groups midline origine have been transsected, so does the temporal muscle, which was removed from the parieto-temporal area of the skull, starting the incision next to the external sagittal crest. A right parieto-parasagittal craniotomy was performed with an oscillating saw (Stryker TPX, Stryker Inc, Kalamazzo, USA) device. The craniotomy did not pass through the midline, we kept 14 mm distance paralel to the external sagittal crest. We made a quadrangular craniotomy with a size of 32 × 24 mm on the parietal bone. The separated bone fragment was placed immediately into saline solution.
After the craniotomy, a durotomy was made using an No. 11 blade to make a 4-sided flap. The opening of the dura mater revealed a part from the right marginal to ectomarginal gyrus. Fluid was drained off by 21G intravenous catheter (VasoFix Branüle, BBraun, Germany) from the trigonal region in order to relax the brain for dissection. With a careful approach between the falx cerebri and marginal gyrus (thus the dorsal sagittal sinus was not exposed and remained protected), then deeper between the left and right cingulate gyri, the corpus callosum was reached. The marginal and ectomarginal gyrus were bluntly dissected, and the gyri (including the cingulate gyrus) was held away with brain spatulas to maintain the field of view (). The corpus callosum was then transected with the spatula and forceps at its midline in the midsagittal plane.
After controlling subsequent bleeding with gelatine sponge (Spongostan Standard 7 × 5 × 1 cm, Ethicon Inc., New Jersey, USA) and bipolar electrocauter (Yasargil Coagulation Forceps, Aesculap Inc., Center Walley, USA), the surface of the tissue mass could be seen. The entire intracranial procedure was supported by an operation microscope (Topcon OMS-90, USA). The tumor was removed with 8- and 12-Ch Fergusson suction cannulas (Aesculap, USA) in multiple fragments until the point when there was no bleeding or visible residual tumor tissue.
The ventricle was filled with body heat sterile Salsol solution (Salsol infusion, TEVA, Hungary). The dura mater flaps were sutured with a 3/0 polyfilament suture (Surgicryl, SMI, St. Vith, Belgium), and the craniotomy fragment was attached to the neighboring bones by drilling one hole on each side of the fragment and the adjacent bones, and anchoring them with a 2/0 polyfilament suture (Surgicryl, SMI, St. Vith, Belgium). The temporal muscle and the superficial auricular muscles were sutured along the midline cut line to their other sided counterparts. The skin was closed in two layers with subcutaneous and cutaneous sutures.
After the surgery, methylprednisolone (Solu-MEDROL injection, 2 mg/bwkg, Pfizer, USA), cefazolin (Cefazolin-Sandoz, 30 mg/bwkg, Sandoz GmbH, Germany), morphine hydrochloride (Morphinum Hydrochloricum, TEVA 20 mg/mL injection, 2–4 mg/bwkg, TEVA, Israel), and mannitol (Mannisol TEVA infusion, 1 g/bwkg, TEVA, Israel) were administered. Strict observation was performed for 24 h, during which period body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, proprioception, cranial reflexes, and mental state were registered. During this observation period, there was an interval when the aforementioned parameters had a higher variance: arrhythmia, decreased heart and breath rate, salivation, absent pupillary light reflex, and absent palpebral reflex. As intervention for this emergency situation, epinephrine (Tonogen 1 mg/mL injection, 0.02 mg/bwkg, Richter Gedeon, Hungary) was administered, resulting in the majority of symptoms resolving except for the excited behavior, absent menace response, and twitching of the right upper lip. The excited behavior improved with midazolam (Dormicum 5 mg/mL injection, 0.5–1 mg/bwkg, EGIS, Hungary).
Neurologic examination on the following day showed an absent menace response on both sides and mild sign of weakness and the dog was dysphoric. The previously absent right sided direct PLR became normal. Mild ventrolateral strabismus was seen on the right side. Further cranial and spinal reflexes did not show any abnormalities. Mild confusion was observed. Behavior, body posture and gait were normal. Proprioception and hopping tests were unremarkable. Bilateral occipital lobe lesion was presumed according to the neurological examination. The dog was discharged after 3 days. During this period, the dog was dysphoric, but this improved with midazolam (Dormicum 5 mg/mL injection, 0.5–1 mg/bwkg, EGIS, Hungary).
At-home treatment was continued with prednisolone for 1 month (Prenisolon-Richter 5 mg tablet, 1 mg/bwkg BID, Richter Gedeon, Hungary), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 1 week (Augmentin 500 mg/125 mg tablet, 20 mg/bwkg BID, GlaxoSmithKline, UK), tramadol for 1 week (Tramadol LA tablet, 2–4 mg/bwkg BID, Aluid Pharma, Germany), and levetiracetam continuously (Levetiracetam TEVA 500 mg tablet, 10 mg/bwkg BID, TEVA, Israel).
Within 1 month of intervention, the dog had two tonic-clonic seizures lasting 5 min each. One month after surgery, control MR examination was performed with the aforementioned machine using the following sequences: T2-weighted sagittal, transversal, and coronal imaging of the head; FLAIR, SWI, and mIP transversal imaging of the brain; and pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging of the cranium in the sagittal, transversal, and coronal planes. The lateral ventricles were moderately enlarged, as in the preoperative examination, but the three fluid-filled cystic structures dorsal to the lateral ventricles at the midline were no longer present. The proliferating CPT seen earlier was gone. The intravenously administered contrast agent appeared in the area of the surgery and vasculature on the right area of parieto-occipital region. On the T1- and T2-weighted sequences, ventral to the pars centralis of the lateral ventricles, the well-circumscribed hyperintense areas with a hypointense rim on the T2-weighted sequences were most likely late subacute hemorrhages. The cerebellum was normal ().
Three months after the surgery, the menace response was still absent, but no more epileptic events were observed, and the dog's general state was stable. Levetiracetam dosage was tapered to 5 mg/bwkg BID and prednisolone was tapered to 0.5 mg/bwkg and administration of steroid was stopped 1 month after the surgery. Four months after the intervention two grand mal episodes were observed. Due to reappeared epilepsy activity, Levetiracetam dosage was increased to 20 mg/bwkg. During the 9 months postoperative follow-up, no more epilepsy events were detected and her vision had not yet returned. Histopathologic examination showed fronds of the differentiated fibrovascular tissue covered by one layer of uniform cuboidal and columnar epithelial cells (). No nuclear, cellular atypia, intratumoral necrosis, apoptosis, or mitosis were seen. The tumor tissue did not infiltrate, but there was compressed adjacent, peritumoral neural tissue, where we could detect mild edema and hemorrhage. Multifocal microcalcification and xanthoma production, furthermore focal lymphocytic reactivation, were detected in the stroma of the tumor (). The epithelial cells showed intense, diffuse, homogeneous cytoplasmatic-pancytokeratin-positivity (). The Ki-67-labeling-index was 1–2%. A benign CPP was ultimately diagnosed.","[[6.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['16724820', '8589799', '15024796', '11191717', '15024798', '24157104', '31065711', '10940770', '30261376', '23322825', '31536979', '30894223', '31380398', '28290001', '21954970', '30391955', '29057852', '26321300', '29247539', '11945007', '27235145', '18691364', '30783805', '25741075', '33134330']"

She had left-sided retrosternal chest pain, which was insidious onset, with on and off episodes, each lasting for one to two minutes with no radiation, aggravated by heavy work and relieved with rest, along with breathlessness, palpitation, pedal edema for one month, and a history of intermittent fever for one-week duration. She did not have other comorbidities, and treatment history was not relevant.
Laboratory examination demonstrated a white blood cell count of 11,000 per microliter and normochromic normocytic anemia (Hb-5gm %). An electrocardiogram was normal (Figure ) and a trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) (Figure ) demonstrated 7 x 12 mm vegetation attached to the anterior mitral leaflet with chordal rupture, causing severe anterior mitral leaflet prolapse. There was severe eccentric mitral regurgitation (MR) and sub-valvular calcification with mitral stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation. She complained of acute pain in the left lower limb. An arterial Doppler ultrasound was performed, which showed a thrombus in the left femoral artery. Left transfemoral embolectomy was performed. As IE was suspected, the clinical team collected three pairs of blood culture in BacT/ALERT bottles before the start of antibiotics and sent for bacteriological culture. Subsequently, empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. The bottles were immediately loaded in BacT/ALERT Virtuo automated instrument. Meanwhile, pregnancy was spontaneously aborted and fetal products were evacuated. Four out of six blood culture bottles were flagged positive after seven days of the incubation following which gram stain and subculture were performed on to blood agar and Macconkey agar. Gram stain revealed highly pleomorphic gram-negative rods of 1-3 µm in length arranged in short chains and rosettes with an irregular staining pattern. Colonies on blood agar were small, circular, flat, non-hemolytic. Biochemical tests performed from the colonies revealed catalase negative, oxidase positive, indole positive, and nitrate negative. Then the colonies were subjected to MALDI-TOF (version 3.2, bioMérieux), which subsequently was identified as C. hominis. The instrument had given a confidence score of 99.9% for the identification.

She was on carbamazepine 400 mg daily, levetiracetam 3000 mg daily, lacosamide 250 mg daily, and lamotrogine 100 mg daily with poor response. Then, she was referred to our hospital (Hospital Universitario Mayor—Méderi) to characterize her seizures. A long-term (72 h) video EEG with scalp electrodes was performed with a 50% reduction of the antiepileptic drug (AED) doses. The video EEG recorded 14 seizures in total. She presented two different types of seizures with different semiology: the first type was a seizure with a focal onset, impaired awareness, and non-motor components such as behavior arrest, cognitive impairment due to disorientation and emotional seizures (psychomotor agitation, fear, and anxiety) and eye blinking. The second one was a focal onset seizure with impaired awareness, motor components such as eye blinking, cephalic version to the right, dystonic extension posture in the right arm (Figure 4 sign), and finally a progression to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure. After video EEG was completed, she was restarted on the full dose of AEDs, achieving seizure control within the next 24 h.
The scalp EEG showed interictal rhythmic spike activity in the left mesial temporal region maximal at the T3 electrode. A Left F7-T3 spike with intermittent fronto-central delta slowing was found. A right interictal temporal spike was also seen at the end of the recording (). Ictal scalp EEG showed 4–5 Hz rhythmic activity that involved the right frontotemporal region. It spread to the contralateral hemisphere, where it was associated with epileptiform activity ( and ).
A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left frontal parasagittal lesion with calcifications without mass effect. Then, a 1.5 Tesla brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) was obtained and confirmed the presence of a 9 × 6 mm left frontal parasagittal lesion with the so-called ‘popcorn’ appearance. The nodule showed smooth, thin, and hypointense borders, with a homogeneously hyperintense core on the T2W (weighted) images. The T2 gradient echo (GRE) images defined the hemosiderin component of the lesion, also known as ‘the blooming effect’. It did not enhance on T1W post-gadolinium images (). Positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging using [18] FDG fluorodeoxyglucose showed a pseudonodular lesion with internal calcifications of 9 × 6 mm approximately without radiopharmaceutical uptake (ametabolic). No abnormal perfusion in the surrounding area next to the cavernoma was found. An acceptable distribution and radiofrequency uptake by other brain structures, including the temporal lobes, was shown ().
In summary, the present case characterized by ictal semiology and onset in the left hemisphere matched to the side of the cavernoma localization. However, the scalp EEG showed a right onset and fast spread to the contralateral hemisphere, meaning there was conflicting evidence regarding lateralization.
According to several guidelines for cavernoma-related epilepsy management [,], surgical resection of the cavernoma was offered to the patient by our epilepsy group. However, the patient declined the procedure for personal reasons, and AED therapy was restarted. Medication dosage was adjusted (levetiracetam 2000 mg daily and lamotrigine 400 mg daily) due to the development of somnolence and drowsiness, resulting in partial control of the seizures.","[[53.0, 'year']]",F,[],"['17884501', '26060902', '21536633', '23036310', '19953116', '28362238', '21829231', '15230704', '21536634', '24134485', '22194115', '30476961', '17886546', '7555991', '15338338', '3579221', '1743154', '29239163', '15975856', '10211470', '17062994', '28426130', '23258521', '20926350', '11502929', '20674276', '27430454', '23968818', '26550535', '24998234', '21353602', '22946719', '25341150', '26452114', '17666072', '3653050', '32846994']"

She denied chest pain, cough, and hemoptysis. She had a decreased appetite but no weight loss. She also reported dull right shoulder pain for three months. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 40 years but had quit 17 months ago. She had worked in the printing business for 23 years. She had no known history of exposure to tuberculosis or asbestosis. Family history was significant for squamous cell lung cancer in her sister at the age of 32 years.
On examination, blood pressure was 137/62 mmHg, heart rate was 81 beats/min, and the temperature was 36.7 °C. She did not have any palpable cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary adenopathy. Heart sounds were regular. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally. The abdomen was non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly. No rashes, pedal edema, or soft tissue nodules were appreciated. Initial lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 8.3 x 103/μL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 509 x 103/μL. Basic metabolic panel revealed serum sodium of 137 mEq/L, serum potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 8 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL.
A CT scan of the chest was done, which showed right upper lobe mass and ipsilateral mediastinal adenopathy (Figure ). Biopsy of the lung mass showed necrotic tissue, which was non-diagnostic (Figure ). Subsequently, an endo-bronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA) biopsy was performed, which revealed enlarged, hyperchromatic cells with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli in the right subcarinal and paratracheal lymph nodes (Figure ). Tumor markers were positive for cytokeratin-7 (CK7), thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and napsin A, consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. Mutation analysis was negative for BRAF V600E, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 2p23, and ROS1 6q22 gene arrangement. The programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score was 100%. At this point, given that she had at least stage IIIA disease and a fairly bulky tumor, she was deemed to not be a candidate for surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. MRI of the brain was negative for metastases; however, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed significant fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the right upper lobe lung mass with direct extension through the chest wall along with the involvement of the ipsilateral mediastinal, neck, and axillary lymph nodes. It was thought that this could be due to lymphatic spread secondary to chest wall invasion, which would classify this malignancy as stage III disease. Notably, the PET scan also showed FDG-avid nodules in the soft tissues of the bilateral buttocks (Figure ). Thereafter, these lesions were biopsied and revealed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (Figure ). Palliative treatment with pembrolizumab, cisplatin, and pemetrexed was initiated. Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress and ultimately she died from complications five months after diagnosis.","[[59.0, 'year']]",F,"['4427150-1', '4427150-2', '6919385-1']","['23242715', '25969680', '11126845', '8633975', '31804329', '10673851', '2617710', '8111469', '32953335']"

The pain began suddenly with no precipitating event, was constant, and was unrelieved by changes in position. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provided minimal relief. Prior to the sudden onset of these symptoms, the patient had begun to wear a faja corset every day, taking it off only occasionally to shower. Review of systems was otherwise negative, and no associated symptoms were reported. The patient reported drinking less than two alcoholic beverages per week, and denied smoking and IV drug use. No significant past medical history was noted. Vital signs were stable, with oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Physical examination was notable for epigastric and right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness. Bowel sounds were auscultated. The abdomen was nondistended and without rebound, guarding, or rigidity. The remainder of the physical exam was unrevealing. Complete blood count (CBC), renal function, liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase were within normal limits. A pregnancy test was negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly and a fluid collection on the anterior aspect of the left hepatic lobe, consistent with a hematoma (Figure ). CT of the abdomen/pelvis confirmed a 13.7 x 5.6 x 9.5 cm subcapsular hematoma (Figure ). With these findings, a diagnosis of subcapsular hematoma of the liver was given. Initially the patient was made nil per os (NPO), with a surgery consultation in place. Surgery suggested that surgical intervention was not recommended at the time as the patient was hemodynamically stable. Additional management included analgesic pain control and muscle relaxants. The patient remained hemodynamically stable from admission to discharge, and required no blood transfusion. Six days from admission, the patient was discharged home with resolution of her pain and was advised to stop wearing faja corsets.","[[36.0, 'year']]",F,['5139769-1'],"['31143321', '27942293', '34745582', '32953334']"

He had a normal coagulation screen; however, he was found to have cytopenias with a white blood cell count of 5.5 K/µL that included approximately 50% blast forms, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 78 K/µL. Marrow showed 70–80% blasts positive for CD34, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and CD5, and negative for PAX-5 and c-Kit (). Flow cytometry (FC) demonstrated the blasts to express markers specific for myeloid (cytoplasmic MPO) and T-lymphoid (cytoplasmic CD3) lineages. Blasts were also positive for CD5, CD7, CD10, CD34, CD11b, CD33, and TdT on FC. Cytogenetics were normal, and no abnormalities were identified on 200 interphase cells examined by fluorescence in-situ hybridization: specifically, analysis showed no evidence of 3q21.3q26.2 translocation or inversion, deletion 5q31, monosomy 7, deletion 7q31, RUNX1T1-RUNX1 translocation, KMT2A rearrangement, CBFB rearrangement, or PML/RARA translocation. Next generation sequencing identified the following mutations: DNMT3A c.2206C > T (variant allele frequency (VAF) 43.9%); DNMT3A c.1755dup (VAF 36.5%); IDH1 c.394C > T (VAF 44.0%); CBL c.1227 + 2T > C (VAF 51.6%); and NOTCH 1 c.5023_5025del (VAF 13.9%). Together, findings established the diagnosis of T/myeloid MPAL. Cerebrospinal fluid was negative by cytology and FC.
Induction treatment was given with 3 half cycles (1A, 1B, and 2A) of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD) and intrathecal (IT) prophylaxis []. This achieved a complete remission (CR), with bone marrow biopsy after cycle 1A, showing no evidence of disease by morphology or FC and no circulating blasts in the peripheral blood. He was transferred to our facility for consideration of consolidation stem cell transplantation. A repeat bone marrow exam was performed and demonstrated continued remission. The patient proceeded to a matched related donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from his brother with reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (fludarabine 30 mg/m2 daily for 3 consecutive days (Flu) and 200 cGy total body irradiation (TBI)) with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis []. Marrow on day 28 posttransplant showed morphologic remission with 0.06% blasts by FC. Markers used to detect MRD by FC included CD45, CD34, CD38, CD48, CD56, CD71, CD117, CD123, CD5, CD7, CD33, cCD3, sCD3, CD4, CD8, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD19, CD64, and HLA-DR. A repeat marrow one week later showed an increase in blasts to 0.1% by FC, and chimerism analysis showed donor CD3 of 40%, CD33 of 85%, and CD56 of 71%. His immunosuppression was tapered and completely discontinued on day 47, and he received donor-lymphocyte infusion with pentostatin on day 50 posttransplant. At day 18 post DLI blasts had increased to 6% by FC; by morphology, a population of 5% TDT + CD34+ blasts were shown. The patient was next treated with one cycle of intensive reinduction using cladribine, cytarabine, filgrastim, and mitoxantrone (CLAG-M) [] plus vincristine and dexamethasone. This was complicated by neutropenic sepsis requiring prolonged intensive care, but the patient made a full recovery, and restaging bone marrow biopsy showed a CR by morphology and FC. A second allogeneic stem cell transplant was planned, but shortly beforehand, the patient developed grade 2 GvHD of the skin and was treated successfully with oral corticosteroids. Given that he was still in CR by FC and hoping the GvHD would correspond to increased graft versus leukemia, the 2nd transplant was postponed. Unfortunately, repeat bone marrow exam approximately 3 months later confirmed low-level relapse detectable by FC. Reinduction with 2 cycles of CLAG-M plus vincristine and dexamethasone (with mitoxantrone omitted from the 2nd cycle) was again administered but associated with substantially increased toxicity to the patient's functional status and a prolonged length of recovery. CR by morphology and FC was briefly achieved before disease was identified at a level of 0.9% by FC on day 441 posttransplant.
At this juncture, the patient was >1-year post-allo-SCT with relapsed T/myeloid MPAL despite several rounds of high-intensity chemotherapy. He was reasonably fit, evidenced by his regular exercise bicycling regimen, but had shown declining tolerance of successive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. He had no clinically active GvHD. Given the paucity of published data to inform this clinical scenario, we presented 3 options for management that included (1) directly pursuing a 2nd allo-SCT using a different donor; (2) additional conventional multiagent chemotherapy; or (3) venetoclax plus HMA. He began venetoclax 400 mg by mouth daily and decitabine 20 mg/m2 intravenous daily on days 1–5 in 28 day cycles. No dose ramp-up of venetoclax was given in the setting of low disease burden. Because of grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia, venetoclax was stopped on day 25. Both cell lines recovered by day 35, and a bone marrow exam at that time showed CR by morphology and FC. A 2nd cycle was given, with venetoclax dose-reduced to 100 mg daily. A full 28 days of venetoclax was administered with recovery of neutrophils and platelets on day 37. Other than cytopenias, the regimen was well tolerated. He proceeded to a 2nd SCT from a matched unrelated donor allograft with Flu/TBI RIC and cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus GvHD prophylaxis []. Engraftment of neutrophils occurred on day 19 after transplantation, and no grade >1 GvHD has been observed to date. At his most recent follow-up 1 year after his 2nd allo-SCT he remains in CR by morphology and FC with CD3, CD33, and CD56 compartments entirely of donor origin.","[[65.0, 'year']]",M,"['6129347-1', '7815380-1']","['30668198', '29218851', '33505737', '27069254', '16443519', '33131256', '32035785', '29339097', '30409798', '10653870', '20485373', '31352981', '34572885', '31248843', '31913151', '30225152', '33101740']"

He describes a six-month history of episodic, diffuse, and crampy abdominal pain. Each episode would last about five to ten minutes and was mild to moderate in intensity. The pain would resolve spontaneously, and there were no associated symptoms, aggravating, or alleviating factors. Three months prior to his presentation, he started experiencing loose, watery diarrhea which would occur every two to three days. He described having three to four loose bowel movements per day, with no presence of mucus or blood. He also complained of anorexia and a 10 lb weight loss over the previous three months.
A comprehensive review of systems was otherwise negative. He denied any fever, chills, or any relation of his diarrhea to food intake, and there was no history of nocturnal diarrhea. There was no recent antibiotic use and no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He denies any joint pain, skin rash, or mouth ulcers. There was no history of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain, or urinary symptoms.
His past medical history was significant for Lyme disease in childhood and attention-deficit hyperactive disorder. There was no history of surgery in the past. He denied any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. There was no family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colon cancer, or any other GI malignancies.
On physical examination, the patient appeared malnourished, evident by temporal wasting. His vital signs were generally unremarkable. He weighed 134 lb (60.8 kg) which puts him at a BMI of 17.80 kg/m2. Examination of the gastrointestinal system was unremarkable, with a soft, nontender abdomen, with no visceromegaly. There was no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. The remainder of the physical exam was normal.
Results of routine hematology and biochemistry investigations including liver enzymes were all within normal limits. Celiac serology was negative, and stool workup including fecal leukocytes, stool culture, ova and parasites, giardia, and cryptosporidium were all negative. His carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was within normal limits.
Colonoscopy showed a circumferentially encasing, partially obstructing, stenotic mass, with overlying granular and inflammatory mucosa in the hepatic flexure (Figures –). The colonoscope could not be negotiated through the mass to evaluate the cecum. The colonic biopsy revealed soft consistency of the mass, and there was excess of bleeding from the biopsy site (). The colonic mucosa of the remaining part of the colon appeared normal, and random colon biopsy was obtained. The histopathology of the hepatic flexure mass was significant for focal active chronic colitis with ulceration, polypoid granulation tissue formation, reactive epithelial changes, and noncaseating granulomata formation that was consistent with granulomatous inflammation (). Special stains for tuberculosis, fungi, and other microorganisms were all negative. The crypt architecture was preserved (), and the histopathological findings were devoid of the basal cell plasmacytosis to conclude to inflammatory bowel disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was unremarkable; biopsies of gastric and duodenal tissues and subsequent testing for Helicobacter pylori infection, celiac disease, and Whipple disease were all negative.
An abdominal CT scan of the abdomen performed with contrast was remarkable for circumferential thickening of the cecum and ascending colon without any evidence of obstruction. There were perihepatic and pelvic ascites in the cul-de-sac and nodular thickening of the peritoneum in the right lateral abdominal wall and minimally at the omentum. The patient subsequently underwent a laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy. The biopsy specimen showed noncaseating granulomas and confluent granulomatous inflammation. Special stains for tuberculosis and fungi were negative.
A CT scan of the chest was performed and revealed a slightly irregular 1 cm pulmonary nodule in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The area of nodular sarcoid cannot be excluded. There was also minimal fissural nodularity which could represent underlying sarcoid.
A diagnosis of colonic sarcoidosis was made, and the patient was treated medically with oral prednisone, starting at 40 mg daily for one week with a gradual taper to a target maintenance dose of 5 mg daily over the course of eight weeks. Upon starting prednisone, the patient improved clinically with the resolution of his abdominal pain and diarrhea, along with a 20 lb weight gain, and remained in sustained symptomatic remission after three months of treatment. A colonoscopy performed five months after treatment revealed interval improvement of colonic stenosis resolution of the inflammatory mass, and the scope could be traversed through the stricture (). Some mucosal inflammation and granularity could be noted; however, there was significant improvement as compared to the index colonoscopy ().

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed a lesion of 4 cm in diameter localized in the head of pancreas with the presence of venous involvement of the superior mesenteric vein () without a clear cleavage plane from the descending part of the duodenum and an initial dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct. Six secondary liver lesions were concomitant (Figures –). In particular, 2 of these lesions ranged from 1 to 2 cm and the other 4 were millimetric ones; so far, we consider it as an oligometastatic cancer. Serum levels of CEA and Ca 19.9 were 721 ng/mL and 11.200 U/mL, respectively (Figures and ). A fine-needle biopsy of both pancreatic and the V segment lesion of the liver reported the diagnosis of malignant cells compatible with moderately differentiated PDAC. First-line chemotherapy according to the modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, folinic acid 400 mg/m2, continuous 44 hours infusion of 5FU 2400 mg/m2, every 2 weeks) was started. After 4 cycles, a CT scan of the abdomen documented a partial response of all target lesions according to RECIST 1.1 criteria []. Nevertheless, due to the appearance of a subocclusive clinical scenario associated with an acute bacterial pneumonia and a rapid decay of performance status, the patient underwent an esophageal-gastric-duodenum endoscopy showing duodenal stenosis associated with severe gastric displacement. Therefore, a palliative gastro-entero-anastomosis was performed associated with a targeted antibiotic therapy for pneumonia. In the following 3 months, only best-supportive care was initiated in order to improve patient's health status. At that time, a new CT scan documented the increase of both pancreatic and liver lesions, serum tumor markers, and obstructive jaundice with high total bilirubin levels (15.7 mg/dL). As a consequence, a biliary drainage was implanted with a rapid restoration of normal bilirubin values. In the next month, the FOLFIRINOX regimen was resumed and 6 cycles were administered without significant toxicities. A progressive decline of CEA and Ca 19.9 was achieved with values of 110 ng/mL and 152 U/mL, respectively. A new CT scan showed dimensional stability of both hepatic and pancreatic lesions associated with a prevalence of necrotic areas (Figures –). Simultaneously, a PET was negative. After one month, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative extemporaneous histological examination of macrobiopsy of two liver lesions at the V segment was negative for malignancy. Thus, a duodenocephalopancreasectomy was performed. Microscopic examination reported the diagnosis of PDAC with negative surgical margins and 7 out of 25 metastatic pancreatic lymph nodes (ypT2N1). After 2 months, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen showed no secondary lesions. ASCO guidelines recommend a total of 6 mounts CT between neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. So far, no systemic chemotherapy was administered in the following 6 months. Next, two consecutive CT scans identified no metastases, showing only three stable subcentimetric liver nodules. During this period, a slow progressive increase of tumor markers was documented.
At the third radiological evaluation after surgery, the liver and lung relapse was observed (Figures –). The patient underwent administration of other 20 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX with a 1-year progression-free survival. The most frequently observed mFOLFIRINOX-related grade 1-2 adverse events were diarrhea, stomatitis, and anemia. Occasionally, grade 3 neutropenia, anemia, diarrhea, and fatigue required dosage adaptions.

EKG performed on arrival (Figure ) revealed a regular wide-complex tachycardia suggestive of supraventricular tachycardia with bifascicular block. The patient’s vital signs on arrival were stable; therefore, a trial dose of adenosine was attempted, which had no effect on the patient.
Subsequently, the patient underwent procedural sedation with propofol and synchronized cardioversion at 100 joules, followed by 200 joules, with no change in rhythm. Further inspection of the EKG showed morphology consistent with RBBB and left anterior fascicular block. These findings were suggestive of anterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia, or BVT.
Additionally, the patient was treated with 2.5-milligrams verapamil intravenously (IV), which converted the aberrant rhythm to normal sinus rhythm. Further cardiac evaluation with troponin-I and echocardiogram were within normal limits.

The pain was rated as 9/10 intensity on a numerical rating scale (NRS). The pain drastically interfered with his ability to continue MMA activities. He underwent X-ray imaging which revealed no obvious defects. However, a CT scan of the lumbar spine demonstrated bilateral L4 pars interarticularis fractures (Figure ).
The patient had tried medication management with ibuprofen and acetaminophen with minimal relief. He also completed an extensive course of PT without any improvement. The patient was not interested in surgical options and was offered interventional pain injections targeting the defects. The patient was counseled regarding the risks and benefits of these injections and consented to proceed with the procedure.
He underwent bilateral injections at the L4 level targeting the pars interarticularis fractures. The solution used for the injections included 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine mixed with 20 mg methylprednisolone per side. The blocks were performed under fluoroscopy without complications (Figures , ).","[[39.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['30876997', '31225524', '28027366', '32047822', '32953331']"

He visited the emergency room twice for abdominal pain without the identification of the source of the pain. His physical examination was completely normal. He was started on twice-daily proton pump inhibitor, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) three months later showed mild exudate and furrows throughout the esophagus, which were most notable distally (Figure ).
The microscopic exam revealed >100 eosinophils per Hpf in both middle and distal esophagus and 60-65 eosinophils per Hpf in the proximal esophagus. He was diagnosed with EoE, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms resolved shortly after starting swallowed fluticasone 220 mcg two puffs twice daily. Repeat EGD four months later showed grossly normal esophagus, and repeat esophageal biopsy showed no eosinophils (Figure ).
Interestingly, his first GI symptom was a prolonged episode of nausea, which developed one week after his household switched from regularly pasteurized cow’s milk to UP organic 2% cow’s milk. No medical evaluation was conducted at that time point, but, in retrospect, it is believed that this initial nausea was due to evolving EoE. The parents carefully recorded his dietary history after this first episode of nausea because of a remote history of tree nut anaphylaxis. No soy, nuts, or seafood were consumed during this period. His only previous exposure to UP milk occurred one to two times per year in the form of children’s non-refrigerate single-serve milk boxes. In the two months following the household switch to UP milk, he progressively developed worsening abdominal pain, nausea vomiting, and postprandial cough. Symptoms improved with the commencement of treatment for EoE and switching back from UP to regularly pasteurized milk consumption. Later, when he has been off swallowed corticosteroids, even regularly pasteurized milk repeatedly exacerbated his GI symptoms.","[[9.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['7204746', '22391333', '25251921', '24813509', '16291608', '18620743', '22743304', '29289462', '26707195', '29549437', '29501345', '25441645', '29156617', '26758862', '32953337']"
25169,7495958-1,32953338,comm/PMC007xxxxxx/PMC7495958.xml,Surgical Management of Cardiac Hydatid Cyst and the Residual Intramural Ectocyst,"We are presenting a case of a 15-year-old male from a rural area living on a farm and raising livestock. He presented with six months history of easy fatigability, shortness of breath, and dull right upper abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed that the patient had tachycardia at rest and hepatomegaly and no other significant findings. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed clear lung fields and mildly enlarged heart. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed few cysts in the liver without any associated lymphadenopathy in the coeliac group of lymph nodes. As part of the workup, the patient had a CT scan of the abdomen, chest, and brain. The CT showed one cyst in the heart, four cysts in the liver, but no cysts in the lungs or the brain (Figures -).
The cystic nature of the lesions and their locations in multiple organs made us think of the HC as the pathology. The serology test for HC using the ELISA test came positive, which helped to confirm the diagnosis. The patient was scheduled for urgent open-heart surgery, fearing the risk of potential rupture of the cyst and the grave consequences which come with that. The patient underwent conventional median sternotomy and aortocaval cannulation with aortic cross-clamp and cardioplegic heart arrest. CT images helped to locate the cardia cyst and its relation to the cardiac chambers. The location of the cyst was confirmed by direct examination of the heart when it was arrested. The cyst was totally located intramurally in the interventricular septum and expanding down mostly to the left side of the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and partly crossing intramurally to the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle making a visible and palpable soft cystic bulge. The myocardium overlying the cyst on the left side of the posterior descending coronary artery on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart was fibrosed, making part of the ectocyst wall. This was the most epicardially prominent part of the cyst and was chosen as the site of aspiration and later incision to evacuate and remove the cyst. Initially, a 50 mL syringe was used to aspirate the cyst and make it less tense to avoid rupturing it during incision (Figure ).
Around 200 mL of clear fluid was aspirated, and the bulge disappeared. After the evacuation of most of the fluid, a small surgical incision of the fibrotic ectocyst was performed from the same site of aspiration (Figure ).
A surgical discard sucker tip was introduced via the incision, and some residual fluid was aspirated. The incision was enlarged to admit forceps to take the cyst out. There was a residual cavity left behind intramurally caused by the cyst. The residual cavity was inspected to make sure that no part of the cyst was left behind, and the wall was intact, and no communication with cardiac chambers was noticed as no blood was ever seen to collect. The cyst and the fluid were sent to the histopathological and cytological exam (Figure ).
The cavity left draining to the base of the heart without closure of the surgical incision, hoping that the normal filling of the ventricular chambers will eventually lead to the collapse of the residual cavity and prevent any future collection. The patient weaned successfully from the heart and lung machine, and a mediastinal drain was left on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart and another on the anterior surface of the heart. The patient was then discharged to the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). After a few hours the patient was extubated from the ventilator without any pharmacological support. After 24 hours, CXR and echocardiography were repeated, and both were normal. The patient was discharged home after six days very stable and was referred to general surgery to deal with the liver cysts in the future.","[[15.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['18094316', '29946454', '26196344', '29860193', '30656388', '29522097', '19931502', '31499211', '25848488', '14559124', '31020132', '28900448', '30486662', '27303247', '31008970', '32953338']"

The disease relapsed in June 2014. Then after a 4-cycle therapy of R-CHOP and a 2-cycle R-IVAC the patient achieved CR2. In May 2015, the patient underwent autologous stem cell transplant. Seven months later, he relapsed again with regions of terminal ileum, appendix, liver, mesentery lymph nodes, left ilium, left femur, as well as axillary and cervical lymph nodes involvement. After a following palliative therapy (thalidomide and rituximab) and 1 cycle of GDP treatment (Fig. A), the patient received autologous CART19 expressing murine anti-CD19 scFv and 4–1BB - CD3ζ costimulatory activation domains after fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion chemothrapy (ChiCTR-OCC-15007008). He suffered from a grade 2 CRS and obtained rapid remission (Fig. B) but developed spontaneous terminal ileal perforation 38 days following CAR-T infusion. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the perforation was subsequently repaired.
Five months after CAR-T treatment, the patient complained about fatigue, decreased body weight, bone pain, abdominal pain, and distension. He soon was confirmed a relapse by follow-up PET/CT scan with the involvement of cervical lymph nodes, clavicle, mediastina, left lung hilar, retroperitoneum, intermesenterium, and pelvic cavity (Fig. C). The CAR-T cell amount in peripheral blood (PB) was evaluated by flow cytometry,[ and a percentage of 0.08% meant CAR-T cells decreased dramatically. A mass biopsy in the neck was performed and showed DLBCL cells expressing CD19 antigen, without local CAR-T cell infiltration.
Then, a second anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy was planned with deliberation. The patient received lymphodepletion chemotherapy with fludarabine (25 mg/m2, d1–d3) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2, d2–d3). Surprisingly, on the day FC infusion was completed, he quickly developed persistent fever with a highest temperature of 39.5 °C. Checking serum cytokines found a remarkable elevation of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ, even without new CART19 infusion (Fig. ). The peak serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ were 32, 29, and 345 pg/mL, respectively. The high fever and serum cytokine levels were similar with his CRS during the first time of CAR-T therapy (Fig. ). Routine blood cultivations and specific virus DNA detections excluded known bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. And finally a Grade 2 CRS was confirmed.[ Meanwhile, the analysis by flow cytometry on anti-CD19 CAR-T/CD3+ T cell percentage in PB showed a sudden rise from 0.08% to 19.8%. As for CAR DNA copies by qPCR analysis after FC chemotherapy,[ there were 438 copies/μg DNA in PB while 2950 copies/μg DNA in mass aspiration of the cervical lymph node. Due the occurring CRS situation, the second CAR-T cell infusion was canceled. The patient suffered from fever for 5 days and slowly recovered with supportive care and without tocilizumab or steroids administration.[ During fever, his lymphoma-associated symptoms disappeared gradually. By day 9 a serum cytokine analysis showed IFN-γ and IL-6 concentrations decreased to normal ranges. About 20 days after the 2nd CRS, a PET/CT scan showed obvious improvement with largely reduced lymphoma involvement (Fig. D).
Unfortunately, 1 month later the patient was complicated with fever and bone pain again. A PET/CT scan showed diffused signs of lymphoma involvement, implying a disease progression (Fig. E). Bone biopsy confirmed DLBCL infiltration and an immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry showed CD19 dim expression on lymphoma cells (Fig. G) as compared with those before FC lymphodepletion chemotherapy (Fig. F). The disease was not controlled by salvage chemotherapy and the patient died due to multiple organ failure 1 month later.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,['6192928-1'],"['29655961', '30518502', '30190371', '29907163', '29397660', '28395546', '29018147', '29728405', '26516065', '30407609', '27111235', '15668127', '28039267', '28031179', '34587552', '30249264', '33120740']"

She often had repetitive blunt microtrauma to the medial aspect of the right thigh against corners of tables while serving at a restaurant. In the general surgery department, she was diagnosed as having muscle inflammation a year ago. She was treated with physical therapy and medication. However, there was no improvement of the symptom. Physical examination at our clinic revealed that the right thigh circumference was 2 cm larger than that of the left. There was tenderness along the medial third of the thigh along with pain upon passive stretching. The patient had no acute inflammatory signs. Although the branching of the toe was present, the pulsation of dorsalis pedis artery seemed to decrease slightly compared with the contralateral side.
Laboratory examination results were all within normal limits. Radiographs of the right femur showed no abnormal lesion either. Ultrasound examination revealed a 3.2 mm × 2.0 mm × 2.0 mm space occupying the lesion at the medial region of the thigh between the sartorius and vastus medialis (Fig. ). Contrast-enhanced spiral computed tomography (CT) performed 1 year earlier showed a tumor-like lesion with ill-defined margins and a few tiny peripheral calcifications. The tumor showed peripheral enhancement. The right femoral vein was obliterated and the lesion encased the superficial femoral artery (Fig. A, B. Focal narrowing of the artery was verified by vessel reconstruction imaging (Fig. C). CT images performed at the time of referral to our clinic showed absence of calcification that was observed previously. However, new focal calcification was observed (Fig. D). Newly developed collateral vein was observed around the previously compressed femoral vein. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging performed 1 year earlier revealed an ill-defined mass-like lesion that compressed the superficial femoral artery and vein. The lesion showed iso-intensity on T1-weighted imaging and heterogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging accompanied by severe perilesional edema (Fig. A). A few focal peripheral calcifications were revealed as low signal foci on both T1- and T2-weighted images. MR images performed at the time of referral to our clinic showed progression to vessel collapse (Fig. B). The painful swelling and limited motion of the knee joint persisted without spontaneous regression for one year. Therefore, surgical excision of the mass was performed. The mass-like lesion surrounding the middle portion of the femoral artery and vein in the right proximal thigh had a hard, irregular margin. It was strongly adhesive to adjacent muscles and femoral vessels. Thus, these adherent tissues and mass with dimension of 5.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm were excised with care without damaging femoral vessels. However, normal morphology did not recover due to loss of elasticity of femoral vessels. Although both the femoral artery and vein lost normal vascular function, the collateral vein was well developed around the lesion. Thus, we performed a femoral-to-femoral graft interposition using the great saphenous vein after resection of only the narrowed region of the femoral artery (Fig. A--C). The examination performed immediately after surgery showed no difference in toe branching or pulsation of dorsalis pedis artery compared with the contralateral side. Histologically, the mass was diagnosed as MO with chronic inflammation and extensive fibrosis as well as ossification (Fig. D). Following the surgery, warfarin was prescribed during wound healing. The patient experienced no pain or swelling in the right thigh. At 12 months after the surgery, vessel reconstruction CT images confirmed normal continuous flow of the femoral artery (Fig. ).","[[41.0, 'year']]",F,['4233230-1'],"['7928399', '12616411', '6481462', '19130083', '25436075', '10868785', '1461667', '1905528', '33120802']"

History was insignificant for chest pain, metabolic disease, or a rate-limiting drug. She had no comorbid conditions like diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or hypertension. She had a heart rate of 35 beats/min and a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (Figure ).
After taking consent from the attendant, a temporary pacemaker wire (SwanGanz™ Bipolar Pacing Catheter, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) was inserted via right femoral access and fixed at the RV apex after confirmation of pacing spike and a left bundle branch morphology on the cardiac monitor. It was fixed and the patient was comfortably moved back in electrophysiology bay. Her hematology, biochemistry, and metabolic profile were normal.
Echocardiography showed no structural heart disease or regional wall motion abnormality. She was being worked up for a permanent pacemaker. On the second day, she developed epigastric pain. She was treated for acid peptic disease after ruling out ischemia on ECG. Additionally, troponin I was done, which was normal. On the third day, her pain was persistent and she was intermittently pacing on the cardiac monitor. Thinking it as the irritation of the diaphragm by the pacing wire, she was moved under fluoroscopy to adjust her temporary wire. The operator was unable to move the lead and she was shifted back and her CT was ordered that showed perforation of the RV and the pacing lead in the abdominal cavity (Figures , ).
A heart team was called, and it was decided to surgically remove the lead after discussing with the patient and taking her attendants consent. The pacing wire was safely removed, and postoperative echocardiography was repeated to look for pericardial effusion. It was normal. She was implanted a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker (CapSureFix Novus®, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

The patient also complained of orthopnea but did not notice any cough, fever, or chest pain. The patient denied any alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use but had a significant past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, hypothyroidism, and stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD). Home medications included amlodipine, benazepril, hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, clopidogrel, cilostazol, atorvastatin, and basaglar insulin. At presentation, the patient had a blood pressure of 176/82 mmHg, a pulse of 78 bpm, a temperature of 98°F, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation in room air of 92%. Physical examination revealed reduced bilateral breathing sounds in the lung bases, distant heart sounds with a normal S1 and S2, no jugular venous distension (JVD), and bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities up to the mid-calf.
Initial testing showed: normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) of 9 g/dL, CKD with a creatinine (Cr) of 1.86 mg/dL and a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 31, an elevated NT-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (PBNP) of 3760 pg/dL, an elevated D-dimer 3110 DDU, and negative cardiac enzymes. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions [Figure ].
Electrocardiogram (EKG) at presentation showed low voltage QRS complexes in most leads, with nonspecific t-wave abnormalities, and the heart rate was 76 bpm in normal sinus rhythm [Figure ].
Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest was done that showed cardiomegaly with pericardial effusion and bilateral pleural effusion [Figure ].
The patient was started on furosemide for diuresis in the face of acute exacerbation of heart failure. She received one day of therapeutic anticoagulation in view of her high Wells score and D-dimer levels indicative of possible Venous thrombo-embolism. A pulmonary embolism was ruled out with a ventilation-perfusion scan. Lower extremity duplex showed no deep vein thrombosis.
An official echocardiogram was performed and showed moderate pericardial effusion (13 mm) with EF 50-55% and diastolic dysfunction [Figure ].
The previous echocardiogram from three months prior showed preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with grade 1 diastolic dysfunction and a trace pericardial effusion. It was decided to continue to monitor the effusion with serial echocardiograms as there was no clinical evidence of tamponade physiology.
The patient's respiratory status mildly improved with continued diuresis. A repeat echocardiogram on the sixth day of hospitalization showed a persistent moderate pericardial effusion (measuring 13 mm) [Figure ]. The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
After discussing options with the patient she agreed to a therapeutic as well as diagnostic pericardiocentesis. Straw-colored pericardial fluid (620 ml) was drained and a pericardial drainage catheter was left in-situ. Pericardial fluid analysis was suggestive of transudative fluid with albumin 2.7 g/dL pH 8, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 179 units, cytology was negative for malignant cells, and macrophages were present. Gram stains and cultures were unremarkable.
The patient's thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T3/T4) levels were within normal limits; her home dose of levothyroxine was continued and hypothyroidism seemed unlikely to be the precipitating factor for her pericardial effusion.
Due to the high output from the pericardial catheter, further investigation was warranted to delineate the etiology of the effusion. Autoimmune diseases screening was done and results are shown in Table .
A diagnosis of pericardial effusion secondary to HILS was made and hydralazine was stopped indefinitely. A repeat echocardiogram a week after stopping the medication showed no pericardial effusion and normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

She also reported a 20-pound weight gain with abdominal distention and bloating despite a vigorous exercise regimen, joint pain, rash on bilateral upper extremities, and oligomenorrhea. During this time, an endocrinologist diagnosed her with hypothyroidism based on a thyroid stimulating hormone level of 5.3 mIU/mL with negative anti-thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase antibodies. As part of her assessment of peripheral neuropathy by a neurologist, a serum protein electrophoresis was ordered, which showed a monoclonal gammopathy of unclear etiology. Routine ophthalmology evaluation revealed left eye papilledema on fundoscopic exam initiating an immediate referral to the emergency department for further evaluation.
Following an extensive inpatient assessment, including head magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture, the patient was given the presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and was discharged on acetazolamide therapy. Further outpatient assessment revealed polycythemia with a hemoglobin level of 16.7 g/dL and a VEGF level of 409 pg/mL, four times the upper limit of normal. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed multiple diffuse lytic bone lesions as well as hepatomegaly. Sacral bone biopsy revealed neoplastic plasma cells. Due to these many clinical findings, the patient was given a diagnosis of POEMS (Table ). As the bone lesions were diffuse, the patient was not a candidate for localized radiation and was counseled for autologous stem cell transplant, as well as for fertility consultation.
During her fertility evaluation, the patient’s antimullerian hormone level was 3.6 ng/mL, with antral follicle count of 18. Oocyte and tissue cryopreservation were discussed; the latter is not currently recommended for hematologic malignancies given concerns for reintroducing disease in the future through auto-transplantation []. The patient elected to undergo oocyte cryopreservation, and began her random start stimulation in the late follicular phase, with an 18 mm lead follicle, estradiol of 129 pg/mL, and progesterone 0.4 ng/mL. She began stimulation with 150 international units (IU) of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and 150 IU of purified urinary human menotropins, but by cycle day three, this was reduced to 75 units each due to acute moderate edema of the hands and feet. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-A) was started at the outset of stimulation due to the advanced follicle size. On cycle day four, laboratory assessment and physical examination by the patient’s oncologist were stable, the estradiol level was 84 pg/mL, and the FSH dose was increased to 112 IU per day.
For prevention of OHSS, the patient was prescribed an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole 5 mg per day) and a dopamine agonist (cabergoline 0.5 mg per day) at the outset of her stimulation. On the advice of her oncologist, she also administered daily prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 40 mg per day). On cycle day eight, with a peak serum estradiol of 177 pg/mL (suppressed by letrozole), three follicles measured 18 mm or greater (19, 22 and 24 mm), and the decision was made to proceed to oocyte retrieval based on follicle diameter. The patient administered a single 2 mg (40 unit) dose of GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate, after which her enoxaparin was held until 24 h after retrieval. During an uncomplicated oocyte retrieval 36 h after trigger injection, seven eggs were retrieved, with four mature and cryopreserved. The enoxaparin, letrozole, and cabergoline were continued for 1 week after retrieval, until the patient’s menses began.

He was in his usual state of health six months ago when he noticed intermittent dry cough and fever. He was treated a few times for upper respiratory tract infection as an outpatient with antihistamines and oral antibiotics with subsequent improvement. He developed intermittent abdominal pain a few weeks prior to admission, which was attributed to suspected gastritis from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) usage. His abdominal pain did not improve with acid suppression therapy and cessation of NSAIDs. He also reported a 30-pound weight loss over the last three months. Review of systems was positive for malaise, lower limb edema, and intermittent loose stools and negative for melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dyspnea, lymphadenopathy, or chest pain.
He was diagnosed with small intestinal lymphoma in 1997 and was treated with partial small bowel resection and chemotherapy for six months and declared to be in remission by his oncologist. His other notable past medical histories included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD stage 4, and gout. As a workup for his CKD and persistent proteinuria, he underwent renal biopsy and was diagnosed with advanced focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), likely secondary, chronic active interstitial nephritis, superimposed with mild IgA nephropathy. He was initiated on high-dose prednisone therapy (1 mg/kg) with the aim of slow taper for his kidney disease as an outpatient a few months prior to the current presentation.
His family history was negative for any renal disease, autoimmune diseases, malignant neoplasms, or young-onset coronary artery disease. He was a nonsmoker, and reported no alcohol usage or any other illicit drug usage. He denied any significant travel history on his initial admission.
His vitals on admission were within normal limits. Physical exam was notable for mild conjunctival pallor and mild epigastric tenderness on deep palpation without any guarding or rigidity. The abdomen was soft and bowel sounds were present in all quadrants. His rest of the physical exam was within normal limits.
His complete blood count (CBC) showed mild normocytic anemia and leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance upon admission. However, a few months prior to admission, he had persistent mild eosinophilia, which peaked up to 12% of total leukocytes with a normal total white count. However, after commencing steroids for renal disease, his eosinophilia had resolved and now developed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance. His basic metabolic panel was consistent with mild acute kidney injury in the background of CKD and moderate hypotonic hyponatremia. His liver function tests, cardiac enzymes, and thyroid functions were within normal limits. His blood and urine cultures were negative. Iron studies were suggestive of anemia of inflammation. He had marginally elevated lipase (Tables , ). His stool for cryptococcus antigen and giardiasis were negative. HIV fourth-generation testing was negative. His stool was not tested for amoeba and Strongyloides as the travel history could not be obtained.
Imaging
His CT abdominal and pelvis showed mild fecal loading and right renal cyst, and was negative for any GI, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic pathology that could explain the patients’ symptoms. His chest x-ray was within normal limits without any obvious infiltrates or nodules. Retroperitoneal ultrasound revealed normal renal parenchyma without any evidence of hydronephrosis.
Differential diagnosis
The differentials initially were broad and included the following.
1. Chronic GI infections or systemic infections with GI manifestations like giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, amoeba infection, intestinal tuberculosis, and HIV, very rarely small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Whipple's disease
2. Chronic GI conditions like gastritis, reflux disease, and irritable bowel syndrome
3. Chronic inflammatory/autoimmune diseases like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease
4. Neoplasms like GI gastric carcinoma, intestinal lymphoma, pancreatic or hepatobiliary neoplasms
His significant weight loss and chronic abdominal symptoms increased the suspicion for GI neoplasms rather than chronic gastritis. Celiac disease was less likely with negative tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies. CT abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any GI neoplasms; however, it could not have been ruled out without endoscopic evaluation.
Treatment
He received intravenous fluids and his symptoms partially improved with the resolution of hypovolemia and hyponatremia. He was evaluated by the gastroenterology team with a plan for outpatient gastroenterology evaluation of his poor appetite and weight loss with EGD and colonoscopy, especially given his history of intestinal lymphoma.
Outcome and follow-up
However, he was readmitted again before his initial outpatient follow-up, with melena and worsening abdominal symptoms. He underwent EGD that revealed a medium-sized hiatus hernia with normal-appearing mucosa, diffuse area of severe erosive gastritis, duodenitis noted in the bulb, and second and third portion of the duodenum. He underwent multiple biopsies from all the above areas. Although there was diffuse ulceration, erythema, and friable mucosa noted in the stomach and duodenum, there was not any evidence of active bleeding. Histopathology revealed numerous Strongyloides organisms in gastric fundic body mucosa, heavy parasite load in the duodenal mucosa, and evidence of chronic active gastritis and duodenitis with ulceration (Figure ). Upon further questioning, the patient revealed his travel history to Cambodia to visit his family two years ago; however, on return he did not have any symptoms.
Infectious disease was consulted. Further workup including stool studies showed infestation by rhabditiform larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis and positive Strongyloides serum IgG antibodies. His steroids were discontinued. He was started on oral ivermectin therapy and continued on acid suppression therapy with proton pump inhibitors. His repeat stool studies remained negative. His previous renal biopsy was reevaluated and did not have any evidence of Strongyloides infection.","[[55.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['362122', '14726461', '26778150', '16738888', '1543206', '16622724', '16204912', '8701797', '3081656', '26029521', '15929539', '27181117', '25848380', '3577128', '17176919', '11528578', '10622101', '33133837']"

The patient was treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the right upper lobe, due to poor performance status and advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Computed tomography of the chest (CT-thorax) performed three months prior to the current admission showed significant improvement in the size of the malignant lesion (Figure ). In the current admission, the patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Initial diagnostic workup including complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and microbiological studies was unremarkable.
A CT-thorax revealed extensive airspace consolidation in the right upper lobe of the lung with a 3.8 cm gas-filled irregular cavity surrounded by consolidation (Figure ). Broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy was initiated and included imipenem.
Diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and resulted in the growth of A. xylosoxidans on microbiological culture (Table shows antibiotic sensitivity testing). The BAL was negative for TB or fungal infections. The cytological analysis revealed no evidence of malignant cells.
CT-thorax was repeated one week after initiation of treatment and showed stable cavitary lesion (Figure ). Oxygen requirement improved significantly and weaning of mechanical ventilation was achieved. However, re-intubation was performed due to excessive secretions and inability to protect airways. After goals of care discussion, the patient and family decided to pursue palliative care.

She was born at term via vaginal delivery weighing in at 2.5 kg and had no history of perinatal problems. The patient was the second child of non-consanguineous, healthy parents. Her medical history was unremarkable and did not include any head trauma, seizure, or infection of the central nervous system. No specific family history was found. The paternal and maternal heights were 169 and 163 cm, respectively, and the midparental height of 159.5 cm was within the normal range.
Ethics Statement: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles (IRB 2019-11-051-001). Parental informed consent was obtained in accordance with institutional review board standards.
The patient was 133 cm (−3.4 standard deviation scores (SDS); 50th percentile in growth curves for TS ()) in height with a growth velocity of less than 4 cm/year. She was 38.1 kg (10th percentile) in weight, and 21.6 kg/m2 (79th percentile) in body mass index. The physical examination was unremarkable. The sexual maturity ratings of the breasts and pubic hair were Tanner stages 2 and 1, respectively. Bone age was 11 years, which was more than 2 years behind her chronological age. The skeletal survey was unremarkable except for a mild scoliosis. Biochemical tests revealed primary ovarian failure: follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) >190 mIU/mL (reference range (RR) 1.6–7); luteinizing hormone (LH) 50.3 mIU/mL (RR 1–7); estradiol <5 pg/mL (RR < 16). Other hormone levels were within normal range: insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) 325.66 ng/mL (RR 181–744); IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) 2668.8 ng/mL (RR 1502–4427); prolactin 8.26 ng/mL (RR < 20); thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 7.7 μIU/mL (RR 0.5–4.5); free T4 1.65 ng/dL (RR 0.7–2.0) (). The results were normal for serum electrolyte, glucose, blood gases, hepatic and renal function, and routine urinalysis. Considering her severely short stature and growth deceleration, we performed a GH provocation test. The sampling for GH levels was carried out every 30 min for 120 min. The peak GH levels were 2.96 ng/mL, 3.63 ng/mL, and 3.06 ng/mL after the administration of arginine, L-dopa, and insulin, respectively. These results are indicative of complete GH deficiency.
Sella magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis revealed a non-enhancing pituitary adenoma measuring 8 mm in diameter with a mild superior displacement of the optic chiasm ().
A conventional chromosome study using peripheral blood showed the 98/177 (55.4%) cells with ring chromosome X, 75 (42.4%) cells with monosomy X, and 4 (2.2%) cells with pseudodicentric ring chromosome X: mos 46,X,r(X)(p22.2q23)(98)/45,X(75)/46,X,psu dic r(X;X)(p22.2q27;q25p11.2) [] (A,B), which indicated a mosaic TS. The subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using an LSI KAL/CEP X probe (Vysis, Abbott Molecular Inc.) and a TelVysion Xq/Yq probe (Vysis) showed that r(X) lacked the KAL (ANOS1) gene on Xp22.3 and the Xq telomere (C–E).
The results of the renal ultrasonography and echocardiography were normal. To evaluate the possibility of other pituitary hormone deficiencies, a combined pituitary stimulation test (i.e., the cocktail test) was performed; decreased cortisol (peak cortisol 12.2 μg/dL; RR > 22 μg/dL) secretion was observed following insulin-induced hypoglycemia, which indicates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (secondary adrenal insufficiency). The patient was administered maintenance physiologic doses of hydrocortisone, and recombinant human GH therapy was also initiated. The initiation of estrogen replacement therapy will be determined by the patient’s growth velocity and emergence of secondary sexual characteristics.","[[13.0, 'year'], [3.0, 'month']]",F,"['5177693-1', '5177693-2']","['15371580', '11056139', '26039527', '24778889', '6507462', '15704128', '24000347', '12948305', '28705803', '7495421', '23586744', '4054225', '25330695', '19293545', '8021781', '26132126', '10549307', '651956', '21648302', '5963207', '11480912', '15588233', '17133108', '10559672', '27387888', '17047017', '14007100', '9140395', '28018463', '8543891', '28099131', '9543547', '24731744', '10749976', '12396562', '34768596', '6028784', '9664587', '27354120', '33020433']"
27578,7647772-1,33178474,comm/PMC007xxxxxx/PMC7647772.xml,Electroconvulsive Therapy in a Renal Transplantation Patient: A Rare Combination of Disease and Treatment,"A 57-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history significant for ESRD and a psychiatric history notable for bipolar-type schizoaffective disorder presented to the inpatient psychiatry unit via the emergency department. He was admitted on a TDO for two days of worsening depressive symptoms including low mood, hopelessness, feelings of guilt and nihilism, and vague suicidal ideation. Additionally, he exhibited concurrent mood-congruent psychosis with auditory hallucinations encouraging self-harm and delusions of impending personal health catastrophe, personal financial bankruptcy, and outstanding criminal charges. An extensive review of the patient's chart revealed sporadic inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations for depression and benzodiazepine abuse dating back to 2005. Regimens of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication for depression and benzodiazepine abuse were tried since 2011, when he first appeared in our electronic health record after relocating to the area. At that time, he carried the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with appetite changes and low mood and was stable with psychotherapy, fluoxetine, and aripiprazole. Prior medication trials included sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, hydroxyzine, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clonazepam, without long-term symptomatic relief. In 2017, he was voluntarily admitted to inpatient psychiatry for an acute episode of distractibility, restlessness, pressured speech, sleeplessness, and auditory hallucinations commanding him to commit suicide. His diagnosis was then revised to acute exacerbation of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. He was hospitalized for nine days, while being treated for mania and alprazolam dependence, and was discharged home on risperidone, which he has been taking since that hospitalization.
In addition to his well-documented psychiatric history, the patient began experiencing a progressive worsening of diabetes-related chronic kidney disease in 2016, which required the initiation of hemodialysis three times per week. In late 2016, his glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was approximately 14 mL/min (nl ≥ 60 mL/min), and renal ultrasound showed extensive echogenicity, enlargement, and cyst formation in the right kidney. The patient began care with a renal transplant surgeon and was placed on the kidney transplant waiting list, meanwhile continuing pharmacologic treatment and regular dialysis. Three years later, in 2019, a living donor renal allograft of the right kidney was performed without acute complications. Treatment with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone was initiated, and the transplant exhibited good function in the subacute phase. His kidney function is monitored regularly, and the patient remains renally stable.
Upon his most recent psychiatric presentation, the patient was overcome with guilt and repeatedly exhibited an overwhelming need to confess to a number of “crimes” he committed over the past six months, which included slandering several acquaintances online, sending his portrait to women he had met on social media, and accessing pornographic content on his computer. He repeatedly admitted that he was fearful but willing to accept any felony charges that would inevitably be brought against him. His spouse regularly communicated with his treatment team and clarified that these events never occurred and that the patient had never been in any legal trouble. The remainder of the patient's delusions was centered around what he perceived as the eventual and inevitable failure of his newly transplanted right kidney, as well as the impending financial difficulty that these health problems would inexorably precipitate. Once again, his spouse assured his treatment team that his transplant surgeon was quite pleased with the kidney's function and that the patient had adequate health insurance to cover any current or eventual medical expenses at the time of presentation.
The patient was being treated with risperidone and venlafaxine at the time of presentation. His delusions and depression persisted despite progressive dose increases of these medications. A judicial authorization was obtained to initiate ECT based on the attending psychiatrist's determination that no other treatment had demonstrated efficacy and that the patient's ongoing suicidality was a major concern. The patient and the family consented to the treatment, and the patient began receiving bifrontal ultra-brief-pulse ECT treatments three times per week. Treatments were conducted under the care of psychiatry and anesthesia in the hospital's designated postanesthesia care unit (PACU) ECT treatment room. Prior to his treatments, a combination of methohexital and succinylcholine was utilized for anesthesia and muscle relaxation, respectively. A Thymatron® System IV Integrated ECT Instrument (Somatics, LLC, Lake Bluff, IL) was used to initiate half-age stimulation at 30% energy. The choice of induction agents, dosages, and ECT stimulation strategy were determined by a consultation between psychiatry and anesthesia per the guidelines of our academic medical center. Following his first treatment, systolic blood pressure episodically rose past 250 mmHg (nl = 120 mmHg), and he was treated with labetalol, which effectively normalized his pressure. During the first two treatment sessions, the patient received postprocedural bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) due to acute respiratory distress. With his fifth treatment, the induction agent was changed from methohexital to etomidate due to a lack of adequate seizure activity. Beginning with his seventh treatment, a clevidipine drip was used for some treatments for the management of occasional significant posttreatment hypertension. Placement of the ECT leads was changed from bifrontal to bitemporal with the patient's eighth treatment due to inadequate clinical seizures at 100% energy. He experienced no headache, memory loss, or other acute neurological complications from these treatments, and his renal function remained stable. The patient was noted to exhibit improvement in his psychosis as early as after three treatments, though his mood did not immediately improve. Following his eighth treatment, his spouse noted that his mood was significantly improved, as the patient was now inquiring about family and neighbors and referring to his delusions much less frequently. He reported little improvement following his ninth session, so the treatment team decided to continue ECT. At the end of treatment twelve, the patient was stable, not exhibiting any paranoia or delusions, and denied suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Prior to discharge, the patient was visibly brighter, more social among his fellow patients, and was actively participating in group therapy sessions, which he refused prior to ECT. Over the subsequent course of his psychiatric hospitalization, the patient reported feeling “happy” and “back on the right track.” His reports of hallucinations and worthlessness noticeably decreased, and he became more open to continued long-term psychiatric counseling. Communication during ECT was maintained with his out-of-state renal transplant surgeon, who was reportedly pleased with the status of his kidney transplant, antirejection medication levels, and blood pressures.","[[57.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['8270586', '7024939', '25093794', '12087782', '3898873', '23707642', '17989386', '9342128', '26578927', '33178474']"

She denied previous trauma and associated weakness or numbness. The patient was diagnosed with MM (isotype: immunoglobulin G λ) at age 63 and was initially treated with thalidomide and dexamethasone and switched to bortezomib upon relapse. The patient thereafter has remained in complete remission. Since diagnosis, the patient received intravenous zoledronic acid 4 mg every month for the past five years and on vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Complete blood count (CBC) was remarkable for hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 81.9 fL. The chemistry panel was unremarkable (Tables -).
The intact parathyroid hormone was mildly elevated at 121.3 pg/mL. Vitamin D and calcium levels were normal. Prior bone densitometry one year earlier showed osteopenia of lumbar spine T score -1.5, osteoporosis of left forearm T score -2.9, and left femoral neck T score -0.8. Bilateral hip X-rays showed bilateral incomplete insufficiency stress fractures along the lateral aspect of both proximal femoral diaphyses (Figures -).
The subsequent bone survey corroborated these findings and did not identify any other neoplastic focus. The characteristic location and presentation were suspicious for bisphosphonate-related atypical femoral fracture. Zoledronic acid was discontinued, and the patient was admitted for prophylactic intramedullary nailing of bilateral proximal femurs (Figure ).
Biopsy of the lesion at the time of intramedullary nailing showed monotypic plasmacytosis in fragments of bone with <5% plasma cells (Figure ) and M-protein 1.5 grams initially suggestive of relapse. However, a review of prior bone marrow histopathology before antimyeloma treatment demonstrated less than 30% plasma cell involvement in the bone marrow and with treatment, the patient remained in clinical remission. Given that the pathologic and radiologic features were inconsistent with myeloma osteolytic fracture and overall clinical context, the patient likely suffered AFF secondary to BP use.

Given the increase in the intensity of the pain, he presented for evaluation. The patient denied smoking and illicit drug use and had not consumed alcohol for over 10 years. The progressive nature of the pain prompted further evaluation by his hepatologist. No acute findings were found on examination or laboratory workup. An ultrasound of the liver demonstrated three suspicious lesions. Given these findings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen with the liver protocol was obtained, which demonstrated three lesions in the liver; all were LI-RADS 3 (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System). At baseline, this patient had an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0. Follow-up MRIs over the next two years portrayed similar-sized lesions and overall stable findings. At the two-year mark, a follow-up MRI demonstrated that the lesion in segment 6 of the right hepatic lobe had increased in size to (1.3x2.2x2 cm) 2.2 cm. This lesion demonstrated arterial enhancement with washout and was categorized as an LI-RADS 5 lesion. He underwent an unsuccessful transjugular liver biopsy. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) at the time was 5.7. He was referred to medical oncology at this point. Given the high clinical and radiological suspicion of malignancy, the patient underwent a liver resection to excise the tumor segments. Two hepatic tumors were found and resected, one in segment 6 of the right lobe and another in segment 4b of the left lobe. The lesion in segment 6 was characteristic of both HCC and CC and was thus was termed biphenotypic cHCC-CC. The lesion in segment 4 lobe was moderately differentiated HCC.
The patient recovered well from surgery. Follow-up imaging did not demonstrate evidence of disease. The patient was placed on three to four monthly surveillance visits and scans. Six months later, his lab work demonstrated elevated AFP. MRI of the abdomen showed a liver lesion in the right lobe segment 6/7 measuring 3.6x3.6x3.3 cm with some vascular flow. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest did not demonstrate metastatic disease to the lungs. The patient then underwent a right hepatic lobectomy with a portal lymphadenectomy. The mass resected was HCC, and one out of the three lymph nodes resected was positive for cholangiocarcinoma. He was commenced on chemotherapy with 5-FU and oxaliplatin. After eight cycles of therapy, he developed abdominal pain, which prompted a CT scan of the abdomen. This demonstrated stable disease. Due to the persistent symptoms, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) was done, which, on the contrary, demonstrated worsening disease. At this point, the option of looking for a clinical trial was explored with the patient. He declined. Given the rising AFP, it was thought that the dominant component is likely the HCC and hence the patient was commenced on nivolumab. He showed some clinical improvement and a stable AFP. After five cycles of therapy, he demonstrated a rising AFP. PET-CT demonstrated significant disease progression. Since he retained an excellent performance status (ECOG 0), we subsequently proceeded with gemcitabine and cisplatin. We attempted to treat both components, HCC and CC, of the disease. Hence, in the setting of disease progression and lack of treatment guidelines, this patient was also commenced concurrently on sorafenib with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Again, he demonstrated clinical stability in the setting of a stable but elevated AFP. He tolerated this therapy very well with a mild hand-foot syndrome, which very quickly responded to salicylic acid 6% cream. A CT scan after three cycles of therapy, along with continued sorafenib treatment, demonstrated stable disease and a slight reduction in the AFP; hence, the current regimen was continued. Unfortunately, at the end of six cycles, imaging demonstrated disease progression and rising AFP. The patient declined a suggestion to explore a clinical trial at a local university hospital.
While he received gemcitabine, cisplatin, and sorafenib, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on his tumor. The results demonstrated a CCND1 genomic alteration, as well as stable microsatellite status and intermediate tumor mutation burden. While there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapy for a CCND1 genomic amplification in biphenotypic cHCC-CC, Palbociclib is indeed FDA-approved therapy for a CCND1 genomic amplification in hormone-positive, advanced or metastatic breast cancer. After discussing with the patient information available from NGS and lack of data to provide evidence of success with palbociclib in the setting of his disease, the patient agreed to pursue this last option of therapy. He was commenced on palbociclib, which portrayed evidence of decreasing AFPs. The patient continued to maintain a good quality of life for two months that he was on Ibrance. He continued to work full time. Blood counts and other necessary parameters were monitored and remained within acceptable ranges. Unfortunately, two months into being on Ibrance, his disease progressed. During this time, the patient developed bilateral pneumonia and died within a week of his infectious diagnosis from sepsis in the setting of an immunocompromised state.","[[52.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['12913082', '28994423', '11932907', '26917546', '24581682', '23293701', '28480073', '32953345']"

At consultation she recalled episodes of red and flaking skin changes on and below her lip. She switched from Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste to Urtekram Aloe Vera toothpaste (Urtekram, Mariager, Denmark), after which improvement of her complaint occurred. Unfortunately, after a few months, this toothpaste also started to cause peri-oral and gingival symptoms.
Both patients were patch tested with our extended European baseline series (TRUE Test panels 1 and 2, supplemented with additional investigator-loaded allergens), as well as a dental and metal series. Patient 2 was also tested with a cosmetics and fragrance series (allergens from SmartPractice Europe, Barsbüttel, Germany and Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Vellinge, Sweden). Van der Bend Chambers (Van der Bend, Brielle, The Netherlands) were applied on the back for 48 hours under occlusion and were fixed with Fixomull Stretch (BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany). Patch test readings were performed at day (D) 3 and D7.
The results of patch testing are shown in Table . Patient 1 showed a positive reaction (+) to tin 50% pet. at D3 and D7. Tin 50% pet. was retested and gave a positive reaction (+) at D3 reaction and a strong positive reaction (++) at D7. Patient 2 showed a positive reaction (+) at D3 and a strong positive reaction (++) at D7 to tin 50% pet. Also, a positive reaction (+) to hydroperoxides of limonene 0.3% pet. at D3 was found, which became negative at D7. Examination of the Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste's ingredients revealed the presence of stannous (tin) fluoride.
Both patients were then patch tested with the Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste “as is” and in a dilution series (50%, 30%, 10%, 5%, and 3% aq.), which yielded extreme positive reactions (+++) at D3 and D7 in patient 1 and at D3 in patient 2. Patient 1 showed positive reactions throughout the entire dilution series and patient 2 down to the 10% concentration. Patient 2 was also tested with Urtekram Aloe vera toothpaste and showed positive reactions (+) to pure toothpaste and all dilutions. Additional testing was also performed with a dilution series of tin (30%, 10%, 3%, and 1% pet.) and stannous fluoride (0.5%, 0.15%, 0.05%, and 0.015% in pet. and aq.) (raw material from Sigma-Aldrich Chemistry, Darmstadt, Germany; dilution prepared at the University Medical Center, Groningen [UMCG]), stannous chloride 1.0% pet. and stannous oxalate 1% pet. (Chemotechnique Diagnostics); see Table . To exclude sodium fluoride as being the culprit allergen, sodium fluoride was tested (raw material from Duchefa Farma [Haarlem, The Netherlands], dilution 0.5%, 0.15%, 0.05%, and 0.015% in pet. and aq. prepared at the UMCG), which gave no positive reactions in either patient.
Three controls were tested with Sensodyne Rapid Relief toothpaste who all showed negative reactions. In 38 controls tested with stannous chloride 1.0% pet., two strong positive (++), five weak positive (+), three doubtful and seven irritant reactions were seen. Of 38 controls tested with stannous oxalate 1% pet., one positive reaction was seen; this subject also reacted positive (+) to stannous chloride. These reactions were clinically relevant in this subject, because she had periorbital eczema and tin was found in her eye shadow. After discontinuation of the use of the eye shadow her periorbital eczema resolved completely. Of these controls, 28 subjects were also tested with tin 50% pet. and showed no positive reactions.","[[62.0, 'year']]",F,['7496776-1'],"['30570581', '29527724', '31872105', '23817056', '29527723', '28291073', '25128131', '8365176', '32212164']"

The abdominal pain was mainly localized to the lower abdomen. The pain was dull in nature, continuous, non-radiating and moderately intense (6 out of 10 in terms of severity). The complaints were associated with shortness of breath, palpitations, loss of appetite and weight loss. The patient denied symptoms of urinary retention/incontinence, constipation or bleeding per rectum. Past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus. Past surgical history and family history were unremarkable. Socially, she was a widowed housewife and non-smoker. With regard to the obstetric and gynecologic history, menarche started at 12 years of age. The menstrual cycles were regular. No use of oral contraceptive pills or hormonal replacement therapy for the past 10 years. Menopause occurred seven years ago. The last gynecological checkup was eight years ago, and Pap smear was negative. The patient had two uncomplicated pregnancies with two babies delivered vaginally at full term.
Laboratory testing revealed a blood hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/L (normal range: 11.9 to 15.1 g/L) and tumor markers were negative. On general examination, a mass protruding through the endocervical canal with active bleeding was seen.
CT scan showed a large uterine soft tissue mass extending to the upper vagina and abutting the rectum and urinary bladder (Figure ). There were multiple metastatic pelvic and lower paraaortic lymph nodes. Also, deep pelvic nodularity worrisome for early peritoneal carcinomatosis was observed. Additionally, several right pulmonary nodules were noted.
A biopsy from the protruding cervical mass was obtained for histopathological analysis. The specimen consisted of multiple pieces and fragments of soft red-tan tissue measuring in aggregates 10 cm. Microscopic examination of the tissue showed sheets of malignant cells with hemorrhage and necrosis. The neoplastic blue cells were discohesive and had spindle-shaped morphology, frequent mitoses and bizarre nuclei (Figure ).
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed diffuse positivity of the neoplastic cells to myogenin, MyoD1 and desmin (Figure ). Conversely, the neoplastic cells showed negative staining for PAN-CK, P63 and CD99. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) gene rearrangement was not detected. In view of the clinical, radiological and histopathological investigations, the final diagnosis was consistent with primary uterine embryonal RMS.
The case was discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. In consideration of the advanced stage disease presentation, the consensus was to consider palliative pelvic radiotherapy (a total dose of 30 Gy, divided into three fractions monthly) to control the active bleeding. The patient would be reassessed after three months.","[[54.0, 'year']]",F,['8358511-1'],"['11413538', '34369193', '11241248', '12879475', '12124838', '17013893', '11846299', '19770626', '23414767', '17325479', '9724344', '29320751', '32953348']"

The patient was firing a 9-mm semi-automatic handgun. Per the patient, the target had been used frequently in the past and was constructed from wood and metal. After discharging his firearm multiple times, the patient reported that everything suddenly went black and he felt his body go limp. Emergency medical services reported 1 liter of blood loss en route.
Clinical findings
On exam, an 11-cm-deep, right-sided facial laceration extending from the lateral aspect of the right lip to the posterior right ear was noted. Further inspection revealed a full thickness laceration to the masseter muscle, with exposed mandible and obvious deformity. A significant pulsatile hemorrhage was evident. The patient’s airway was patent, lungs clear, Glasgow Coma Scale 15, and extremities atraumatic.
ED management
Rapid sequence intubation, including the concomitant administration of midazolam, propofol, and succinylcholine, was undertaken, massive transfusion protocol initiated, tranexamic acid (TXA) administered, and the patient prepped for immediate surgery.
Surgical management
The patient was taken to the operating room by the trauma and oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) teams for hemorrhage control, surgical debridement, and wound closure. Following the initial operation, the patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the maxillofacial structures, which confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the right mastoid and mandibular condyle (Figures -). Four days after the initial insult, the patient underwent a right mastoidectomy and facial repair. The OMFS team elected for conservative therapy for the condyle fracture. On discharge, the OMFS team reported a physical exam consistent with House-Brachmann VI.
Outcome
The patient was referred to an outpatient neuro-otologist with an immediate follow-up exam demonstrating paralysis consistent with House-Brachmann V. Three months later, the patient’s facial wound had healed well with no signs of infection (Figures -). He reported an improved ability to raise his right eyebrow and close his right eyelid as well as difficulty hearing on the affected side. He further reported some difficulty chewing initially but tolerated a liquid diet for eight weeks before slowly progressing to a soft diet. The patient continued to have partial right facial paralysis on examination.","[[36.0, 'year']]",M,[],"['14663802', '9486900', '24350120', '22070881', '30429930', '23011579', '1527828', '18274030', '23449809', '21326792', '32953366']"

Past medical history was only significant for hypertension. Approximately six weeks prior to this presentation, he began experiencing right hip pain, which radiated to his right groin. This prompted an emergency room visit where he had a computed tomography (CT) scan of his right hip that was negative for an acute abnormality. He was diagnosed with lumbar radiculopathy and treated with a muscle relaxant. Two weeks later, he had intermittent subjective fevers, chills, and hot sweats along with dyspnea prompting another emergency room visit. Chest x-ray showed right lower lobe consolidation suggestive of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP), and he was discharged on therapy with oral antibiotics. A few days after completing the oral antibiotics, he started experiencing right shoulder pain. He presented a third time to the emergency room. As the patient had dyspnea and fever, there was a concern for right-sided complicated pneumonia. A CT scan of the chest revealed a single 8 x 12 x 9 cm hepatic abscess in the absence of pneumonia (Figure ).
At admission, the patient was in acute distress due to rigor with a fever of 41 ºCelsius, tachypnea of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 135/80 mmHg, and tachycardia of 100 beats per minute. The physical exam was remarkable for right upper quadrant tenderness on palpation. The patient had dentures with no signs of any periodontal infection. His labs were significant for leukocytosis of 18,000/mL with neutrophil predominance, lactic acid of 2.9 mmol/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm/hr, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevated at 164 U/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) elevated at 132 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 35 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) mildly elevated at 58 U/L, and normal total bilirubin. Urine analysis was negative for infection, and human immunodeficiency virus testing was negative. Hemoglobin A1c was 5.8%, which ruled out diabetes mellitus as a contributing factor. Once blood cultures were drawn, he was initiated on intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and fluids for acute sepsis due to liver abscess. He underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of the liver abscess by pigtail catheter placement. Liver abscess fluid was purulent, blood-tinged indicative of infection. Both the blood and liver abscess cultures grew S. constellatus susceptible to ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, and vancomycin with intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. Repeat blood cultures done a day later were negative.
S. constellatus typically originates from the oral, intestinal, and urogenital tract, but our patient had no symptoms of pathological involvement of these systems. The patient denied any abdominal pain or distension. He did admit to having loose stools three times a day on two days a week before this admission. He had no significant travel history and denied any history of gastrointestinal issues, alcohol use, or recent dental or abdominal procedures. He had a colonoscopy four years ago for screening that was normal. Due to the presence of dentures, a panorex x-ray was done, which revealed no infection. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was done to identify the source, which disclosed sigmoid diverticulitis, and an adjacent 3.5 x 4.3 x 4.1 cm contained pericolonic abscess (Figure ).
The patient showed an excellent response to the IV antibiotics, and his right shoulder pain wholly resolved. The pigtail catheter was removed on the day of his discharge. He was discharged home on IV ceftriaxone and oral metronidazole to complete a total of six weeks of IV antibiotics. A repeat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a decreased liver abscess size with a resolution of sigmoid diverticulitis and pericolonic abscess. The patient completed the antibiotics with an improvement in his symptoms. He underwent outpatient colonoscopy, which was positive for two hyperplastic descending colon polyps (removed) and sigmoid diverticulosis.","[[54.0, 'year']]",M,['8577612-1'],"['28434021', '17407038', '16377869', '26656355', '19888200', '31559551', '22423344', '8651751', '21435221', '31744789', '6472091', '34804302', '30091401', '33200054']"

At birth, she was reported to have a large head circumference. At 6 months of age, she had her first epileptic seizure and continued to have episodes every other month until she was diagnosed with generalised idiopathic tonic-clonic epilepsy. At 13 months, she was administered sodium valproate (Epilim) for the treatment of epilepsy. At 16 months, her parent started noticing signs of impaired mobility, such as lack of balance and frequent falling. By 3 years of age, her valproate medication was stopped because she had stopped having seizures but this resulted in a longer seizure that kept reoccurring over a period of 7 h. She was treated with phenytoin and put back on her former medication.
At school, this patient started showing signs of delayed learning and impaired memory retention as well as weight fluctuations. Symptoms of impaired mobility (imbalance, inward toeing while walking and continuous falling) still persisted and at 8 years old, she was diagnosed with hypermobility. By the age of 9, she was referred to an endocrinologist who offered genetic testing. Array comparative genomic hybridisation revealed a deletion in the proximal region of the genomic locus 16p11.2 (29 673 953–30 198 600), spanning approximately 524 kb. At this time, the patient continues to have moderate–severe learning and memory impairments. She is also presented with several ASD traits, although no official ASD diagnosis has been made. For example, she struggles with change of routine and gets emotionally attached to objects. Moreover, she has sensory difficulties. She dislikes loud noises, music or over-populated areas.

A case report,"A 45-year-old female patient presented with a history of fever, cough, and sputum production for 5 days. From February 6, she had a fever, accompanied by general weakness, chills, muscle aches, as well as a cough. After taking azithromycin orally for 3 days, the symptoms did not improve significantly. CT scans on February 7 showed bilateral, blurred patches, pleural thickening and adhesions. After being admitted into an isolation ward, she was intravenously administered levofloxacin for 3 days but a fever remained. Meanwhile, the results of two consecutive tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid were both negative. She was then transferred to the respiratory single ward on February 11. Upon closer examination of the patient and the medical history, the doctor noted said individual’s developing red, itching rashes on both hands in mid-January 2020. After topical use of miconazole clobetasol cream, the itching symptom reduced while the rashes remained. In this period, she had no muscle aches or myasthenia.
The patient’s previous surgical trauma history included a right lung nodule resection in November 2017 which’s tissue pathology alluded to carcinoma in situ, a thyroid adenoma surgery over 10 years ago and an ovarian cyst surgery in 1999.
At the end of January 2020, she had worked as a radiological technician in a fever outpatient department, but she had no obvious history of close contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients.
A general physical examination revealed smooth breathing with rough bilateral sounds, and wet rales that could be heard at the base of the right lung. Heart and abdominal examinations showed no abnormality. Dermatological examination showed erythema, a condition which mung-bean-sized pimples with scales and scabs could be seen on the palms, extensor and flexor of the knuckles and metacarpophalangeal joints. Periungual folds were diffusely red with angiotelectasis, hyperkeratosis, and petechia (Fig. a,b).
Laboratory examinations showed ferritin was 462 ng/ml (Ref. 13~150) and interleukin-6 was 70.05 pg/ml (Ref.0 ~ 7). Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase were higher than normal limits (Table ). Myositis antibody spectrum examination and autoantibodies showed anti-Ro52 antibody was strongly positive. The examinations including anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (anti-MDA5) antibody, anti-Jo1 antibody, anti-Scl70 antibody, antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, anti-Sm antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Pathogen examination of respiratory system produced no significant results.
After in-patient admission, above mentioned subject was given a combination of anti-infective therapy for 1 week, but afterwards she still exhibited hyperthermia. On February 17, CT imaging revealed progressive changes and the oxygenation index showed a sharp decline. After a multidisciplinary consultation, she was immediately transferred to the ICU quarantine ward. After 3 days of active treatment, she still had a 39.5 °C fever, and her oxygenation index continued to deteriorate. At this time, the third nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was administered indicated a negative result. Comprehensively considering the patient’s clinical manifestations and auxiliary examination results, she was diagnosed with CADM associated RP-ILD. The patient was immediately given non-invasive ventilator-assisted breathing, methylprednisolone (up to 120 mg/day), gamma globulin (0.4 g/kg/d), and cyclophosphamide.

The patient mentioned unprotected contact with his brother, who was infected with SARS-CoV-2, 1 week prior to the development of his symptoms. Neurological examination showed reduced power (3-out-of-5) in bilateral lower limb muscle groups, plus gait ataxia, and areflexia in bilateral knees and ankles. He had no sensory deficits and no other central nervous system or other neurological signs and symptoms. Emergency electromyography (EMG) of the lower limbs was performed, which revealed delayed latencies but normal conduction velocities (Table ). Unfortunately, upper limbs were not tested and no biopsy was performed, upon ED admission, as the patient was processed rapidly to investigate the COVID-19 status. However, these EMG findings were considered to be quasi-normal, and thus our differential diagnosis included peripheral neuropathy (demyelinating versus axonal) accordingly., , , Physical examination depicted bilateral crackles on the lung bases. The saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) was 78%, on room air, and the rest of vital signs were within normal limits. The patient was connected to a high-flow nasal cannula (flow: 60 L/min, fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2]: 40%) maintaining SpO2 of 89%. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was suspected due to the epidemiologic background and the clinical presentation.
Baseline laboratory results showed lymphocytopenia (0.51 × 10⁹/L, normal: 1.1-3.2 × 10⁹/L) and increased inflammatory biomarkers defining CRS such as C-reactive protein (247 mg/L, normal: 0-5 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1222 µ/L, normal: 100-190 µ/L), D-dimers (3.6 mcg/mL, normal: 0-0.5 mcg/mL), ferritin (1123 ng/mL, normal: 23-336 ng/mL), and interleukin-6 (778 pg/mL, normal range 1-7 pg/mL). Creatine kinase was slightly increased (616 µ/L, normal: 22-198 µ/L), but renal function and the rest of biochemistry report were within normal limits. Toxicology screen was negative. The coagulation profile was normal apart from increased D-dimers. However, low levels of ADAMTS 13 activity with antibody titers within normal limits (TECHNOZYM®ELISA) were detected (ADAMTS 13 activity: 8%, normal >10% ADAMTS 13 IgG: 9 µ/L, normal: 6-12 µ/L). These tests were performed as the thrombotic risk was considered to be high (D-dimers > 3 and possible COVID-19 status)., , , , , Moreover, a full work-up for other systemic disorders (ie, autoimmune diseases and antiphospholipid antibodies) was performed accordingly.
Although there were no central nervous system signs or symptoms, a lumbar puncture was performed by a consultant neurologist, and subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a normal cell count (2 × 10⁶/L, normal: 0-8 × 10⁶/L) and protein (12 mg/dL, normal: 8-43 mg/dL). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR assays (targeting for RdRp gene, E gene, and N gene of SARS-CoV-2), which were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Light-Cycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche) as previously described., Contrast chest computed tomography scans depicted peripheral bilateral ground-glass opacities and excluded pulmonary embolism (Figure ).
Fourteen hours post-ED admission, the patient developed severe hypoxia (SpO2/FiO2 ratio: 100) and septic shock; hence, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). We administered ARDS-net and prone positioning ventilation, and empiric therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, interferon beta-1b, broad spectrum antibiotics, intravenous vasopressors and hydrocortisone, prophylactic anticoagulation, and supportive ICU care as per hospital protocol. Echocardiography and cardiac enzymes were normal while lower limb sonography excluded deep vein thrombosis. However, the patient's clinical status was deteriorating; hence, we applied rescue TPE as detailed elsewhere. Briefly, TPE was initiated using the Spectra Optia™ Apheresis System, which operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2019 guidelines. A dose of 1.5 plasma volumes was used for the first dose then one plasma volume daily. Plasma was replaced with artificial Octaplas LG® (Octapharma AG), which is a fresh frozen pooled plasma product that underwent viral inactivation by prion reduction technology to minimize the possible risk of infectious agents' transmission. Three daily (4-hour) sessions of TPE were applied without any complications (ie, allergy, coagulopathy, infections, cardiac, and renal system side-effects) recorded. After the completion of TPE sessions, SpO2/FiO2 ratio exceeded 350 with gradual radiological improvement, and we were able to wean off vasopressors. Moreover, patient's inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimers, and interleukin-6 levels) along with the ADAMTS 13 activity/antibody levels were normalized with a parallel sustained increase of lymphocyte counts (Table ). He was extubated on day-7 post-ICU admission. RT-PCR test and microbiology were negative on day-18 post-ICU admission. All the work-up for other systemic (ie, autoimmune disorders) diseases and viral infections was negative. He was discharged to the neurology ward on day-20 post-ICU admission. On day-30, follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of head and spine, and motor nerve conduction studies of upper and lower limbs were normal, as was lower limb power and gait. Thereafter, the patient was discharged to home isolation.","[[44.0, 'year']]",M,['8294023-1'],"['22361373', '32312628', '32105304', '2172810', '34510542', '25714758', '34312122', '32303591', '34306871', '32220112', '30373638', '31890994', '25643015', '32240762', '11328326', '32350026', '32763058', '32291094', '32422061', '15961865', '9781538', '32487122', '32268022', '32448332', '32463468', '32325026', '32354690', '32250385', '32192578', '32171076', '32678530', '21422765', '32074444', '32275288', '32651579', '30304428', '32132196', '31331708', '32473124', '32482845', '32246917', '32271988', '33230414']"

The mother was reported to have complications during pregnancy. She haemorrhaged the night before her due date and the following afternoon she was induced. At birth, the child had low birth weight (2.88 kg) and was supported in a temperature-controlled incubator. At the age of 3, her parents started noticing signs of speech and motor delay; however, a diagnosis of ASD was not met at this stage. She was then supported by an occupational therapist, to develop and strengthen fine and gross motor skills. However, at 4 years, she was diagnosed with ASD, global delay and anxiety and was offered genetic testing by her paediatrician. Molecular karyotyping results revealed a deletion in chromosome 16, region 16p11.2 (29 634 212–30 199 805). This spans approximately 565 kb. Currently, she is not on any medications.

She initially came to us with the chief complaint of facial droop. She underwent extensive stroke workup that came out as negative for any acute findings. On further evaluation, she had an associated complaint of progressively worsening dysphagia for solid food over the last two weeks. This led to further workup and eventually she was diagnosed with new-onset paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis after her serologic testing came out positive. She was started on prednisone 40 mg and pyridostigmine 60 mg every six hours. She had a remarkable improvement in her dysphagia, unfortunately, a day later, she developed chest pain suddenly. It was severe in intensity, pressure like in nature, and radiating towards her left arm. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) done for chest pain, as seen in Figure , showed diffuse ST-elevations which had significantly changed from her previous baseline EKG done on initial presentation to the emergency department (Figure ). We checked for her cardiac enzymes and they were found to be elevated as well [,]. Pyridostigmine was hence stopped, and a drug-eluting stent was placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) which showed 70% stenosis after the patient underwent cardiac catheterization. The patient was monitored in the cardiac care unit (CCU) for 24 hours, downgraded to the Medicine floor, and later on discharged home on oral prednisone.","[[88.0, 'year']]",F,['2637291-1'],"['6253831', '1972859', '19166602', '11132996', '8190158', '813507', '8423226', '4415644', '3769179', '8349804', '11482919', '2105173', '32953356']"

He was born with low birth weight (2.60 kg) and slight macrocephaly. From 3 to 6 months, he kept losing weight. Between 6 and 10 months, he was diagnosed with rickets and was given vitamin D supplements. By the age of 2, the patient showed symptoms of social and emotional delay and was offered occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech therapy. He was then referred to a neurologist who diagnosed him with ASD around the age of 3. The patient also showed severe language impairments, whereby the age of 3 he could only speak three words and communicated with his parents through sign language for 2 years. He was also reported to have a few episodes of febrile seizures; however, EEG tests showed no signs of epilepsy and seizures resolved during childhood. Following that, he was offered genetic testing by his paediatrician. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 16; particularly at the region 16p11.2 (29 567 295–30 177 916) which spans approximately 611 kb.
Between 4 and 5 years, the patient started exhibiting repetitive movements as well as verbal/phonetic tics triggered by calling his name.

The child started with a tactile fever and reduced oral intake a few hours earlier on the day of admission. Her parents took her to the local ED, where she was noted to have a temperature of 39.9°C with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. An intravenous (IV) access was established, and the patient received a dose of lorazepam. Furthermore, she was given four more doses of lorazepam and levetiracetam to abort seizures. After that she was noted to have respiratory depression and oxygen desaturation. She was endotracheally intubated with propofol and rocuronium and placed on a mechanical ventilator. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate personal protective measures were taken during the endotracheal intubation. The patient also received a dose of IV acetaminophen and one normal saline bolus 20 mL/kg for borderline blood pressure post-intubation. Infectious workup was pursued in the setting of febrile seizure, and screening labs were obtained. Blood culture and urine culture were collected, and a dose of ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg was given. Ethanol, salicylate, and acetaminophen levels were normal. Her urine drug screen was negative. Her complete blood count showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 17.69 × 109/µL, neutrophil predominance, and microcytic anemia. She had no thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia. Her C-reactive protein was mildly elevated at 1.4 mg/dL; her electrolytes, blood glucose, urea, creatinine, and liver function test were unremarkable. Her lactic acid was elevated at 5 mmol/L. The urine analysis showed mild ketones and protein without evidence of urinary tract infection. The respiratory viral panel was negative. COVID-19 testing was sent, and the result was pending. A CT image of the brain was normal. Per the parent report, the child is fully immunized and did not have nasal congestion, cough, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The parents denied seizures or COVID-19 exposure in the family. However, her father had cough and congestion for the previous few days and was not tested for COVID-19.
The patient was transferred to our PICU on propofol infusion. Upon arrival to PICU, she was appropriately sedated on the mechanical ventilator, and was normothermic, with stable hemodynamics. The child was able to move all extremities in deep stimulation, and her bilateral pupils were equal and reactive to light. Admission blood gas and repeat lactate were normal, and her chest X-ray showed patchy infiltrates bilaterally (Figure ).
A repeat nasopharyngeal swab using real-time polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was sent and returned positive. Within two hours following admission, the child had a recurrence of seizure, which was aborted with a dose of lorazepam and a loading dose of fosphenytoin. The neurology service was consulted, and the patient was started on maintenance levetiracetam. The child was kept on continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring for 24 hours. cEEG showed generalized slowing without recurrence of seizures. A lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sent for analysis. CSF showed one nucleated cell per mm3, less than 500 red blood cells per mm3, protein 12 mg/dL, and glucose 86 mg/dL. The CSF viral meningitis and encephalitis panel was negative. Due to testing restrictions, we were unable to send for COVID-19 testing in CSF or serology. The patient was continued on ceftriaxone, and vancomycin was added. On day 2 of the PICU stay, she was extubated under deep sedation to nasal cannula oxygen, and then was gradually weaned off to ambient air. She remained afebrile throughout her PICU stay, and antibiotics were discontinued as 48-hour cultures were negative. The child was discharged the following day on levetiracetam maintenance and advised to follow up with the neurology outpatient clinic in two weeks.","[[2.0, 'year']]",F,['7384710-1'],"['32426749', '32742835', '31986264', '32275288', '31861926', '32067542', '33679571', '16757599', '32179660', '27518687', '20113545', '34449704', '32271728', '34060701', '32730234', '32187458', '32953347']"

The pain started one day earlier, and he didn’t have chills or fever and there was no change in bowel or urinary function. He did not have any chronic illnesses and no history of familial disease. His heart rate was 90 beats/min, blood pressure 120/85 mmHg, and he had a normal body temperature of 36.8°C.
On inspection, he had normal skin, a flat abdomen moving with respiration, although it was a little restricted in upper regions. The physical examination showed generalized guarding with rigidity especially in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions along with marked tenderness. However, no mass was palpable in the right hypochondrium, possibly because of tenderness and guarding. Laboratory investigations showed a white cell count of 10.5/mm3 with left shift, hemoglobin 15.7 g/dL, lipase 4,383 U/L, and amylase 316 U/L. His liver enzymes and serum bilirubin were within the normal range whereas procalcitonin was 12.16 ng/mL (normal 0.10-0.49) and C-reactive protein (CRP) was 94 mg/dL (normal 0-10). Serum lactate was normal 0.5 mmol/L (normal 0.5-2.2). Ultrasound abdomen showed inflamed gallbladder with multiple small stones, 5-7 mm in size, with air (pneumobilia) and a bulky pancreas. The common bile duct (CBD) was 5 mm in diameter without intra-hepatic biliary dilatation. CT abdomen showed acute necrotizing pancreatitis involving the pancreatic head and body, the gallbladder appears to have an hour-glass configuration/septated with two separate cystic chambers. The gallbladder was moderately dilated with mild diffuse wall thickening, multiple 5-7 mm calculi in its lumen, and minimal pericholecystic collection along with air and air-fluid levels within the lumen (pneumobilia) (Figure ).
Tiny specks of air were also noted within the gallbladder wall. Its wall adjoining the pancreatic head is significantly thinned out, suggestive of peripancreatic necrosis involving the gallbladder, acute emphysematous cholecystitis, and minimal ascites. The patient was nursed in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) due to the risk of rapid deterioration with the diagnosis and CT findings. He was started on meropenem and blood culture showed no bacterial growth of any organism. After fluid administration and stabilization of vital signs, he underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with findings of an acutely inflamed gallbladder with fibrinous adhesions and pus collection in the Morison pouch and pelvis. Surgery was uneventful and the pus culture from the bile grew E. coli sensitive to cephalosporin, and it was changed accordingly. Histopathology of the gallbladder reported acute on chronic cholecystitis and necrosis of the wall without malignancy.
He stayed two days in the surgical ICU and was shifted to the floor thereafter. He was continued on antibiotics for seven days and managed for pancreatitis. As he continued to have intermittent abdominal pain in the epigastric region, even after a week of cholecystectomy, magnetic resonant cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was done to visualize the biliary system and the pancreas although his liver functions and bilirubin were normal. It showed an inflamed choledochal cyst of the distal part of the CBD and small stones, along with necrotizing pancreatitis with multiple abscesses not amenable to drainage (Figure ).
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was planned to remove the stones in the lower end of the CBD having a choledochal cyst. However, it was not carried out, as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) prior to ERCP did not show any choledochal cyst or common bile duct stones (Figure ).
The patient improved significantly over the ensuing days and was discharged two weeks after admission in good general condition. He was followed up in the clinic at one and three months with no complaints or complications and normal liver function tests (LFTs).","[[21.0, 'year']]",M,['3998211-1'],"['11804880', '30887298', '12006686', '9608373', '5089624', '21799598', '20416491', '30584127', '10521957', '11727104', '24876461', '174453', '2083919', '23100216', '32953350']"
